## 1. What this is

Two systems joined by one bridge, governed by one permission model:

- **Command Center** (`llm_station/`, this repo) — the execution plane. A
  contract-validated control plane (LiteLLM gateway, Judge Gate, Ledger,
  Proactive Runner) that lets coding agents (Claude Code primary, Codex CLI
  fallback) do real repo work inside leased, isolated worktrees — with
  deterministic checks, LLM judge arrays, human approval gates, and GitHub
  branch protection as the final wall.
- **Growth OS** (`appflowy_kanban/growth-os/`) — the human surface and
  knowledge base. Self-hosted AppFlowy boards (todos, mission intake, papers /
  repos / signals, packages, guidelines, DAGs, library), self-updating
  watchers, a local assistant, an MCP server, and a Discord gateway — all
  backed by **one action layer** (`growthos/actions.py`).
- **The bridge** (`scripts/kanban_bridge.py`) — the only join between them.
  Approved kanban cards become Ledger missions; mission status is stamped back
  onto the cards.

The one-sentence design: **many channels, one brain gateway, one action layer,
one approval wall** — open-source local models do the routine work for ~$0;
Claude Code / Codex are engaged through gated missions for the big things; a
human drag-to-Approve and GitHub branch protection are the two boundaries no
agent can cross alone.

## 2. The contract model — the one rule

The whole system obeys one rule, and that rule is what makes it hard to break:

```
configs/*.yaml      = the editable source of truth
schemas/*.py        = Pydantic contracts that validate it
generated/*         = disposable rendered output (never hand-edited)
ledger.sqlite       = the only runtime state
Makefile / cc.ps1   = the only operator interface
.env                = secrets (never in YAML, never committed)
```

Edit YAML → `make validate` → `make render` → run a target. Nothing runs until
validate passes; nothing external happens until the Ledger and gates approve
it; nothing reaches a main branch without GitHub enforcing it.

**Proven, not asserted** — these bad edits are rejected by `make validate`
before they can ship (all tested):

- a typo'd key (`priorty:`) → rejected (`extra="forbid"`)
- two models with the same priority in one role → rejected
- two canaries in one role, or `canary_weight` outside 0–1 → rejected
- a missing risk tier, or **L3/L4 without `requires_approval`** → rejected
- a `repo_task` environment that is persistent or holds secrets → rejected
- a provider (OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter) route in a LiteLLM role → rejected
- a scheduled check proposing L3/L4, `on_fail: auto_fix`, stewardship above
  L2, a check with no owner/schedule/evidence → rejected (eight cases firing)
- `scout.propose_only: false` → rejected ("swap to the leaderboard top" is
  not representable)

The dangerous mistakes — silently broken routing, an approval gate quietly
disabled, a sandbox that leaks secrets, a wandering refactor agent — cannot be
committed in the first place.

The config files and their contracts:

| File | Governs |
|---|---|
| `configs/models.yaml` | which model each role maps to (local-only, ranked candidates) |
| `configs/judges.yaml` | judge arrays per stage, cross-provider pairing, budgets |
| `configs/gates.yaml` | L0–L4 risk/approval policy |
| `configs/environments.yaml` | one environment per activity, isolation rules |
| `configs/standards.yaml` | durable operating standards for Claude, Codex, and Judge Gate |
| `configs/breakage.yaml` | what ripples when you change a file (powers `make impact`) |
| `configs/proactive.yaml` | scheduled checks on already-done work, RCA caps, daily self-improvement scan |
| `configs/targets.yaml` | the watch inventory: repos, DAGs, data assets, services + SLOs |
| `configs/tools.yaml` | tool permissions the judges can cite |
| `configs/evals.yaml` | routing/judge regression suite = the model-promotion gate |
| `configs/kanban.yaml` | bridge dispatch contract: sections, risk ceilings, ready statuses |
| `configs/ui.yaml` | WebUI safety defaults (single-container, password, ledger-governed writes) |
| `configs/channels.yaml` | chat transports (Discord/Slack/Telegram/WhatsApp) → transport + model alias |
| `configs/improvement.yaml` | self-improvement experiment definitions (+ `improvement-targets.yaml` per-target refs) |
| `configs/discovery.yaml` | daily-scan knobs: ranking / triage / code-health / acceptance (no inline literals) |
| `configs/agent_surface.yaml` | agent-kanban knobs: board-state re-injection cadence/size, fuzzy addressing, tuning bounds (`AgentSurfaceConfig`) |
| `configs/autonomy.yaml` | whole-system autonomy hardening: event contracts, repo manifests, desktop rights, canary blockers, telemetry/auth/runtime gates |

---

## 3. Physical layout — machines and the mesh

| Machine | Role | Why it's here |
|---------|------|---------------|
| **VPS** ($5–12/mo, 2 vCPU / 4 GB) | always-on brain | Must be up when the house, 4090, and 5080 are all off. The load-bearing decision — the brain can't live on hardware that sleeps. |
| **RTX 4090 desktop** | heavy worker + local model tier | Runs DAGs/CV, the git worktrees agents edit, and the free local models (Qwen/Devstral) for triage and cheap judging. |
| **RTX 5080 laptop** | human workstation | VS Code Remote Tunnel into the 4090's worktree; dashboards. You drive; the agent works. |
| **Pi / mini-PC** (optional) | home relay only | Wake-on-LAN for the 4090, watchdog, backup mirror. Skip unless needed; a mini-PC beats a Pi at 2026 prices. |

The brain reaches the muscle over a **Tailscale private mesh** — no public
SSH, no public dashboards. All web UIs bind to 127.0.0.1 and are reached over
Tailscale. Nothing is public unless you deliberately add Caddy + Cloudflare
Access (on the do-not-build list by default).

> **Current state (2026-06-12):** everything still runs on the Windows
> workstation; the VPS/4090 split and the Linux migration
> (`growth-os/deploy/linux/MIGRATION.md`) are the standing next steps when the
> prod box revives.

## 4. Architecture — what runs where

### The control plane (Docker Compose, on the VPS / currently local)

| Service | Job |
|---|---|
| **LiteLLM + Postgres** | The local-only model gateway to Ollama. Virtual keys restrict clients to approved aliases. Pinned by **digest** (never a tag, never pip — the March 2026 PyPI compromise is the cautionary tale). |
| **Judge Gate** | Risk classification + the judge arrays. Mounts `configs/standards.yaml`, so every judge cites the same rules rendered into repo instructions. |
| **Ledger (SQLite)** | Missions, leases, signed approvals, the kill switch, the audit log. What makes "keep working while I'm away" safe rather than just possible. |
| **Proactive Runner** | Scheduled checks on already-done work. Holds no secrets; its strongest autonomous act is opening a gated mission. |
| **Discord Gateway** | Discord ↔ LiteLLM (`chat`) ↔ the Growth OS action layer. Fail-fast without `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`. The `chat` role is qwen3 (instruct), **not** qwen3-coder — chat surfaces narrate before tool calls, and qwen3-coder's Ollama native parser drops those calls (see §14, 2026-06-13). |
| Uptime Kuma + restic | Health monitoring and backups. |
| *(optional profile `ui`)* **Agent Kanban UI** | First-party Cline-styled board + observability over the Ledger (missions kanban) and the agent-call log (metrics). **Read-only** — no write path; approve/kill stay in the signed Ledger endpoints, which it links out to. Loopback + Tailscale + password; `configs/ui.yaml` (`agent_kanban_ui`), repurposed from the deferred Hermes WebUI. React/Vite SPA built + served single-container by a FastAPI backend. |
| *(optional profile)* Hermes | **Not adopted — evaluated 2026-06-13 → DEFER.** Hermes Agent is real now (v0.16.0, PyPI/official image); the old "phantom image" note is stale. An isolated spike (see change log + `evaluation/capability-assessment/hermes/DECISION.md`) found cross-session memory works but is just a local `MEMORY.md` (not beyond-stack) and self-improving skills did not auto-fire. LiteLLM + Ollama + the action layer serve its role; revisit only if autonomous skill self-improvement materializes. |

### The worker (4090 / currently the same workstation)

- **Ollama** serving `qwen3-coder:30b`, `qwen3:30b`, `devstral:24b` (Q4,
  ~14–19 GB on the 24 GB card).
- **Git worktrees + devcontainers** — one isolated checkout per mission,
  ephemeral, no secrets.
- **Executors**: Claude Code (primary) and Codex CLI (fallback), authenticated
  by their own subscription/OAuth logins, never via API keys.

### Growth OS (always-on curator loop, `docker-compose.curator.yml`)

Watchers on a cadence — hourly: curate (+enrich) and airflow_sync; daily after
06:00: brief, guidelines, retention; every 15 min (host task): the kanban
bridge; on demand/host: packages, import_books/dags, selftest.

### The two human gates (the only UX that matters)

1. **Approvals**: drag a card to Approved on the board, or sign L3/L4 in the
   Ledger UI / a chat channel.
2. **Merge**: GitHub PR — CODEOWNERS review + required checks. The bot can
   never merge.

---

## 5. Model lanes and routing

LiteLLM is **local-only** in this repo. Every LiteLLM role renders to
`ollama_chat/...` against `OLLAMA_API_BASE`. There is **no cloud fallback**:
if Ollama is down or a virtual key isn't allowed an alias, the call **fails
closed**.

| Lane | Runs | Auth | Provider API charge |
|---|---|---|---:|
| **LiteLLM local gateway** | `triage`, `chat`, `planner`, `local-judge`, `security-judge`, `architect-judge`, `coder` aliases | `HERMES_LITELLM_KEY` / `JUDGE_GATE_LITELLM_KEY` (virtual keys you mint) | $0 |
| **Ollama on the 4090/host** | the actual model runtime behind LiteLLM | none | $0 |
| **Claude Code executor** | primary coding missions in leased worktrees | Claude subscription/OAuth login | $0 |
| **Codex executor** | fallback coding missions | ChatGPT login | $0 |

Hard rules, all enforced by validation and the live smoke test:

- **No provider API keys anywhere** — not in `.env`, process env, user env, or
  machine env. `scripts/check_forbidden_providers.py` and both live-smoke
  scripts verify this; the contract rejects provider routes in roles.
- The executor CLIs are **not generic APIs** for the gateway — they are
  controlled subprocesses that work only inside leased worktrees, behind the
  same pre-commit/pre-push gates.
- Local role meanings: `triage` first-pass risk sorting; `chat` the
  conversational gateway surface (Discord/Slack/…), qwen3 instruct so tool calls
  parse even when the model narrates first; `planner` plans + validation plans,
  also qwen3 (Hermes tool-calls through it, so it must be tool-robust);
  `local-judge` continuous cheap judging; `security-judge` local security/scope
  skeptic; `architect-judge` high-effort planning/debug; `coder` dry-runs and
  fallback summaries (not the executor auth path). **Tool-using roles (chat,
  planner) must not use qwen3-coder** — its Ollama native tool parser drops
  prose-prefixed calls; `make validate` enforces this (`check_tool_safe_roles`).

Two Ollama gotchas worth pinning: agents need **≥64k context** (Ollama
defaults to 4,096 — raise `num_ctx`), and Ollama serves **one request at a
time by default** (set `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` and `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=-1` so
parallel judge calls don't queue or thrash reloads).

### 5.1 External routing reference — Puppetmaster is BORROW_PATTERN_ONLY

Reviewed 2026-06-14 from the pasted Puppetmaster README plus its upstream
GitHub/PyPI docs and this repo's live contracts/tests. Decision: **do not
install or adopt Puppetmaster as a runtime router in this stack**. It is useful
as a reference for auditable routing and typed worker artifacts, but a wholesale
install would introduce a second supervisor/model registry/hook layer next to
LiteLLM, Judge Gate, the Ledger, and the approval wall. Its cloud/API
cost-router mode also conflicts with the local-only boundary above.

What is already done here:

1. **Local-only role contract** — `configs/models.yaml` roles must be
   `provider: ollama`, `local: true`; provider API keys are rejected by
   validation and forbidden-provider checks.
2. **Executor routing contract** — Claude Code is the primary leased-worktree
   executor; Codex is the cross-provider fallback/verifier path; local models
   do not become primary coding executors.
3. **Model discovery gate** — `model-scout` is propose-only and annotates
   candidates with real VRAM fit; promotion still requires validate, evals,
   canary, comparison, and a human tap.
4. **Routing improvement target** — the coded improvement loop already has a
   `routing` target with `routing_accuracy`, `routing_regret`, and
   `unsafe_downgrades`; it can evaluate routing changes without adding a third
   party runtime.

Borrow from Puppetmaster as patterns only:

- emit a typed `ROUTING` artifact for each non-trivial route decision;
- record the picked role/executor, required capability, source config hashes,
  observed token/cost fields when LiteLLM supplies them, and rejected
  alternatives with concrete rejection reasons;
- classify failures before retry/escalation: Ollama unavailable, model missing,
  model OOM/context-fit failure, invalid JSON/truncation, tool-parser failure,
  executor missing, timeout, auth/session failure, and human-approval-required;
- store worker/judge outputs as typed artifacts with evidence references,
  confidence, outcome, and sha256 so follow-up reads reuse artifacts instead of
  rerunning models.

Do **not** borrow:

- global hooks, MCP auto-invocation, or prompt-submit interception;
- cloud provider/API routes, OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter keys, or a cloud
  fallback;
- a second model registry outside `configs/models.yaml`;
- a second job/artifact store outside the Ledger;
- silent fallback. A missing model, unsafe route, missing artifact field, or
  unavailable service fails loud and leaves an event; it does not fabricate a
  route, cost, metric, or success.

Data/privacy rule for any borrowed artifact shape: record only bounded,
operator-useful metadata and references. Do not persist raw chat transcripts,
secret-bearing environment values, `.env` content, provider tokens, full diffs
that may contain secrets, or hidden eval content. Evidence should be a path,
hash, mission id, config hash, redacted excerpt, or deterministic check result
unless a human explicitly approves retaining the full artifact.

Ordered next work (do not skip ahead):

1. **Done now — document the decision.** This section is the reference point:
   Puppetmaster is pattern material, not a runtime dependency.
2. **Done 2026-06-14 — make Judge Gate routing data-derived.** The inline
   `services/judge_gate/app.py` risk→alias table has been replaced by
   `configs/gates.yaml` `default_route_alias` values, required by schema,
   cross-checked against `configs/models.yaml`, and loaded by Judge Gate at
   startup. Missing or dangling aliases fail loudly; no inline defaults, fake
   costs, or hidden fallbacks.
3. **Add Ledger routing artifacts.** Add a small typed event/artifact for route
   decisions using only the fields above. The artifact should cite source
   config hashes and real LiteLLM usage fields when present; when usage is
   absent, say `unknown` rather than estimating dollars.
4. **Measure before learning.** Feed the new artifacts into the existing
   `routing` improvement target only after there is a declared fixture set or a
   pre-registered statistical plan. Until then the deterministic harness stays
   the baseline; do not invent thresholds or train on leaked outcomes.
5. **Then consider a one-mission adapter spike.** Only if artifacts show a real
   routing/work-reuse problem the current stack cannot solve, run a
   Ledger-invoked Puppetmaster adapter experiment with hooks disabled, no
   provider keys, no global installs, and rollback evidence. That experiment
   must pass the external capability-evaluation loop before any pilot.

### 5.2 External AI-agent idea intake — broad prompt first

Use [agent-ideas-evaluation-prompt.md](agent-ideas-evaluation-prompt.md) when
the candidate is broader than a single obvious dependency bump: ClawCodex,
Agno/GitWiki, SIA, MAPPA, codebase-memory-mcp, local-ai-server, dbt Wizard,
BigQuery Graph / ADK / A2UI / BigSet, agentcookie, or a generic multi-agent
framework. The goal is to decide whether there is a measured gap and a safe
capability to extract before any install, pilot, hook, daemon, provider key, or
control-plane change.

What is already done:

1. The broad prompt exists and starts from the implemented stack, not stale
   brainstorming assumptions.
2. The narrower [capability-evaluation-loop.md](capability-evaluation-loop.md)
   now points back to the broad prompt for wide candidate sweeps.
3. The no-build list below now rejects candidate bundles that lack a measured
   gap, control-plane overlap matrix, threat model, and pre-registered
   experiment plan.
4. The first read-only routing/performance pass is complete:
   [routing-performance-candidate-evaluation-2026-06-14.md](routing-performance-candidate-evaluation-2026-06-14.md).
   Verdict: improve routing natively first; pilot `codebase-memory-mcp` only as
   a manual read-only retrieval benchmark; keep Puppetmaster, MAPPA, Agno/GitWiki,
   A2UI, Docker Model Runner, and dbt skills as patterns/conditional pilots;
   reject control-plane/runtime adoption for ClawCodex, OpenClaw, generic
   agent frameworks, BigSet, agentcookie, and SIA-in-production.

Remaining order for this candidate batch:

1. Mission 1 is complete through final independent verification:
   Judge Gate classify routing is now config-derived from `configs/gates.yaml`
   and cross-checked against `configs/models.yaml`.
2. Add typed Ledger route artifacts and route failure classes before learning
   from routing. Missing usage/cost data is `unknown`, not estimated.
3. Run a pre-registered read-only `codebase-memory-mcp` benchmark against
   `rg`, Semble, and native agent search. Binary-only/manual invocation first;
   no auto-install, MCP registration, hooks, skills, instruction edits, or UI
   daemon before it wins.
4. Add deterministic post-run attribution inspired by MAPPA only after route
   artifacts exist.
5. Evaluate Git/Markdown knowledge projection against OKF/AppFlowy only after
   recurring-query gold cases exist.
6. Benchmark Docker Model Runner only behind LiteLLM, and only if Ollama
   throughput/context/reproducibility becomes a measured bottleneck.
7. Promote anything only through the existing improvement/verification/GitHub
   wall; no candidate may become its own evaluator or source of truth.

### 5.3 Continuous upgrade loop — Mission 1 verified

The continuous capability upgrade prompt is now active as a bounded evidence
program, not permission to keep adding tools. Current cycle:
**config-derived Judge Gate routing**.

What is done:

1. Baseline captured in
   [evaluation/continuous-upgrade/BASELINE.md](../evaluation/continuous-upgrade/BASELINE.md)
   and
   [evaluation/continuous-upgrade/baseline.json](../evaluation/continuous-upgrade/baseline.json).
2. Capability state register created:
   [evaluation/continuous-upgrade/capability-register.md](../evaluation/continuous-upgrade/capability-register.md).
3. Mission 1 evidence created with gap, experiment, machine-readable config,
   threat/privacy/authority review, and rollback:
   [GAP.md](../evaluation/continuous-upgrade/mission-1-config-derived-judge-routing/GAP.md),
   [EXPERIMENT.md](../evaluation/continuous-upgrade/mission-1-config-derived-judge-routing/EXPERIMENT.md),
   [experiment.yaml](../evaluation/continuous-upgrade/mission-1-config-derived-judge-routing/experiment.yaml),
   [THREAT_PRIVACY_AUTHORITY.md](../evaluation/continuous-upgrade/mission-1-config-derived-judge-routing/THREAT_PRIVACY_AUTHORITY.md),
   [ROLLBACK.md](../evaluation/continuous-upgrade/mission-1-config-derived-judge-routing/ROLLBACK.md).
4. Baseline commands passed before implementation: `uv run cc validate`,
   `uv run cc mission-dryrun`, `uv run cc evals`, and
   `uv run pytest tests/test_routing.py tests/test_safety_boundaries.py
   tests/test_sealed_evals.py tests/test_improvement_lifecycle.py` (39 passed).
5. The AI packages/tools notes were reconciled as inventory, not implementation
   truth. In particular, Hermes is not the active coordinator; it remains a
   previously deferred candidate per the existing evaluation record.

Current state:

- Config-derived Judge Gate routing: `INDEPENDENT_VERIFICATION_PASSED`.
- Implementation status: implemented in isolation.
- Promotion status: not requested; not promoted.
- Independent verifier status: initial verifier result was `FAIL` because this
  status section and `experiment.yaml` were stale, not because of a functional,
  security, or architecture block. The first re-check returned
  `PASS_WITH_LIMITATIONS` because older backlog text in this file was stale;
  after that text was corrected, the final narrow re-check returned `PASS`.
- Security posture: no new provider keys, daemons, MCP registrations, hooks,
  raw transcripts, hidden eval access, global config writes, second gateway,
  second ledger, or second scheduler.

Remaining order:

1. Do not promote Mission 1 automatically. Human approval remains required for
   promotion.
2. If accepted, include Mission 1 in the next reviewed commit/PR with the
   evidence artifacts.
3. Start Mission 2 next: typed Ledger routing artifacts.

### 5.4 Open-weight model discovery and benchmark loop

This is now the ordered path for finding better local/open-weight LLMs without
letting a leaderboard or scheduled scan change production routing.

What is done:

1. `model-scout` now emits an open-weight-only candidate set by default. A source
   row is kept only when it has explicit open-weight evidence or is a local
   Ollama tag with installed weights. Aider polyglot rows remain useful public
   coding-score context, but they are filtered out of the open-weight feed unless
   another source supplies open-weight provenance.
2. `curated-openweight` is now a version-controlled scored source for candidates
   whose public benchmark evidence can be joined to an exact local Ollama
   identity. A curated record must declare model family, release id, source model
   id, source model URL and payload hash, Ollama tag, Ollama digest, parameter
   size, quantization, context length, license, benchmark name/version, score
   definition, evaluation date, source URL, retrieval timestamp, source payload
   hash, and justified candidate roles.
3. The curated source performs a strict identity join against the installed
   `/api/tags` record. Digest, parameter size, quantization, context, configured
   license, and candidate role names must match exactly. Mismatches fail loudly;
   no closest-name matching, parameter inference, license inference, or role
   expansion is allowed.
4. Local Ollama candidates now carry source provenance from `/api/tags` and
   `/api/show`: Ollama tag, digest, quant, parameter size, native context,
   VRAM-fit verdict, max fitting context, and headroom. Missing metadata is
   recorded as unknown/error; no digest, license, context, or fit value is
   fabricated.
5. `make model-scout` now writes both the human report
   `generated/model-scout-report.md` and the machine feed
   `generated/model-scout-feed.json`. The daily scan can consume that feed with
   `make improvement-scan FEEDS=generated/model-scout-feed.json`.
6. The daily scan understands `model_scout_candidate` records. It drafts only
   `Proposed` `model` experiments for scored open-weight candidates, and it
   carries declared candidate roles so a coding score can draft a coder
   benchmark without implying planner, judge, or routing superiority. It states
   that local role-specific A/B is required before any routing recommendation.
7. `configs/model-benchmarks.yaml` is validated by `cc validate` and defines the
   role-specific benchmark suites plus each suite's metric policy. Prompts,
   metric names, expected/forbidden markers, structured JSON expectations, and
   metric tags live in config, not in code.
8. Structured-output benchmark cases must declare `response_format: json` when
   they use `required_json_keys` or `expected_json_values`. Validation rejects
   JSON-scored cases without that declaration, and it also rejects `json` mode
   on cases that have no JSON checks. The live harness passes declared JSON mode
   to Ollama as `format: "json"`; there is no permissive parser fallback.
9. `command_center.improvement.live_model_benchmark` is registered as a live
   model A/B harness. It requires explicit experiment parameters for role,
   suite, baseline model, candidate model, suite path, and local Ollama endpoint.
   It stores only hashes, booleans, latency, token-rate data when Ollama reports
   it, metrics, and equivalence metadata in Ledger artifacts; it does not retain
   raw prompts or model outputs.
10. `command_center.improvement.model_baselines` builds baseline-only experiments
   from the current incumbents in `configs/models.yaml`. It requires an explicit
   local endpoint, derives runtime budget from configured suite size, repetitions,
   timeout, and generation limits, records artifacts in the Ledger only when
   `--apply` is used, and never writes live benchmark experiments into
   `configs/improvement.yaml`.
11. `command_center.improvement.model_metric_audit` reruns live incumbent suites
    into an isolated audit Ledger/evidence directory and checks metric/sample
    math, expected sample counts, artifact presence, and redaction. It is for
    proving the benchmark machinery, not for promotion.
12. `command_center.improvement.model_candidate_audit` runs one isolated
    baseline/candidate/verifier audit for an explicit role and context. The
    evaluated context must be supplied directly or derived from current VRAM fit
    evidence with explicit `fit_ctx` and `gpu_budget_gb` inputs. The live harness
    passes that context to Ollama as `num_ctx` and stores it in the equivalence
    key.
13. The runner's comparison recommendation now requires at least one required
    non-safety metric to improve in the good direction before it can say
    `promote`. Passing by tie/no-regression returns `revise`, even when all hard
    gates pass.
14. The human wall is unchanged: scout and scan can propose only; benchmark
   runner can only move to awaiting verification; canary and promotion remain
   human-only.

Metric policy for open-weight model upgrades:

1. Use **open-weight** as the enforceable gate. "Open source" may be recorded as
   an additional governance note, but the routing lane requires locally runnable
   weights plus explicit provenance. A high public score without open-weight
   evidence is capability context only.
2. There is no single "best LLM" score. The board is role-specific:
   - triage/planner: structured-output validity, instruction adherence,
     tool-call correctness, escalation quality, and bounded task completion;
   - coder: issue-resolution rate, patch-apply success, test pass rate,
     edit-format compliance, compile/lint success, diff minimality, and
     rollback frequency;
   - local judge: labeled-case calibration, missed-defect rate, false-block
     rate, safety-missed-defect rate, and bias checks for position/verbosity;
   - long-context repo reader: effective context length, retrieval-at-length,
     multi-hop repo reasoning, latency growth by context, and failure shape
     (omission, contradiction, truncation, or tool misuse);
   - terminal agent: terminal task pass rate, command ordering, stderr/error
     handling, isolation behavior, and no secret exfiltration.
3. Every role uses the same metric hierarchy:
   - **Primary metrics** decide whether the role actually improves.
   - **Hard non-regression metrics** cover reliability, safety, structured
     output validity, data handling, and canary regressions.
   - **Supporting metrics** cover speed, VRAM headroom, context cost, token
     throughput, cold/warm load behavior, and concurrency stability.
4. Source trust is explicit:
   - benchmark-only source: useful for public capability context, not enough for
     eligibility or promotion;
   - provenance-only source: proves license/tag/digest/quant/local install, not
     superiority;
   - promotion-grade evidence: local role-specific A/B artifacts plus
     validation, evals, canary telemetry, independent verification, and human
     approval.
5. Public benchmarks are proxy evidence. Prefer continuously refreshed or
   contamination-aware suites for discovery and tracking. Static benchmark
   saturation or leakage is a reason to reduce trust, not to invent a score.
6. Promotion evidence is incumbent-relative. A candidate can become
   recommendable only by beating the current role incumbent on the same suite,
   machine, quant, context settings, and run protocol, with bootstrap/confidence
   evidence when stochasticity matters. Universal thresholds such as "promote if
   score > X" are not allowed in the model-upgrade lane.
7. Acceptable outcomes are **Pareto improvement** (better on at least one
   primary metric and not worse on hard non-regression metrics) or **contextual
   specialization** (better for a declared workload slice without unacceptable
   regressions elsewhere). Both remain proposed recommendations until the human
   promotion wall.
8. Local runtime evidence is first-class: time to first token, prompt processing
   throughput, steady-state output tokens/sec, cold-load and warm-load time,
   VRAM fit/headroom, OOM rate, context-window scaling cost, concurrency failure
   rate, and repeatability across restarts/quant variants.
9. Privacy rule: model benchmarks use synthetic or public tasks first; raw
   prompts and outputs are not retained by the live harness; artifacts store
   hashes, metric summaries, case ids, and equivalence metadata. External
   evaluation traffic or raw transcript retention requires explicit approval.
10. Risky coding, terminal, or repo-writing evals run isolated. A benchmark that
    executes generated code must use the repo's isolation path before its result
    can be treated as promotion-grade evidence.

Current evidence and boundary:

- The latest scout run used sources `aider-polyglot`, `local-ollama-tags`,
  `curated-openweight`, and `artificial-analysis`. `artificial-analysis` was
  skipped because `AA_API_KEY` was not intentionally set. The report contained
  five candidates and the machine feed contained one scored, provenance-resolved,
  role-bound record.
- The feed record is `devstral:24b` for the `coder` role only. It carries
  Apache-2.0 license evidence, Ollama tag `devstral:24b`, digest
  `9bd74193e93935e9d8564d88607b220a9d341c4a36b748cffcbd9ad4f47a9ca9`,
  quant `Q4_K_M`, parameter size `23.6B`, native context `131072`, SWE-bench
  Verified score `46.8`, Mistral source payload hash
  `ef183a2ddb914a564c5131de082569b477c648a2a5c7c77eade732ccf1a6bdf9`, and
  Hugging Face model-card payload hash
  `c84d253789fe8a9d9e4e2fdfaba9302e7723a49130c35ba55be5a5523556cdc1`.
- The daily scan consumed `generated/model-scout-feed.json` and drafted one
  `Proposed` model experiment. No candidate was moved to Canary, Verified, or
  Promoted.
- The same scout evidence reports `devstral:24b` as `NO @ 64k` on the current
  24 GB budget. The current fit-derived candidate audit records
  `devstral:24b max_ctx_fits=50257` and `qwen3-coder:30b
  max_ctx_fits=40806`; both are below the requested 64k context on the 24 GB
  budget. Therefore challenger A/B runs must either use a candidate that fits
  the declared evaluated context or explicitly declare a lower-context
  specialization before running.
- A real local Ollama incumbent-baseline pass has been recorded in the Ledger
  with one repetition for each production role. This is a pilot distribution,
  not enough for promotion-grade statistical evidence.

Incumbent baseline pilot, recorded from local Ollama:

| role | incumbent | task success | invalid response | median latency ms | note |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| triage | `qwen3-coder:30b` | 0.000 | 0.000 | 2899.819 | Structured output was parseable, but all role metrics failed. |
| chat | `qwen3:30b` | 0.000 | 1.000 | 3469.380 | JSON/tool-call contract failed. |
| planner | `qwen3:30b` | 0.000 | 1.000 | 3518.636 | Structured plan contract failed. |
| coder | `qwen3-coder:30b` | 0.667 | 0.000 | 3688.417 | Passed core patch reasoning, failed no-fake/no-fallback/test-awareness tags. |
| local-judge | `qwen3:30b` | 0.500 | 0.500 | 3413.881 | One labeled judgment passed, one failed or malformed. |
| security-judge | `qwen3:30b` | 0.000 | 1.000 | 14014.187 | Security judgment contract failed. |
| architect-judge | `qwen3-coder:30b` | 1.000 | 0.000 | 3129.806 | Pilot passed the configured architecture cases. |

The baseline artifacts are stored under
`data/improvement/EXP-model-baseline-*/baseline-*/` as redacted stdout,
`metrics.json`, and `equivalence.json`. Artifact inspection found no raw prompt
or model-output markers from the benchmark fixtures.

Deep live audit evidence:

- `uv run python -m command_center.improvement.model_metric_audit --reps 2
  --base-url-env OLLAMA_BASE_URL` ran all seven production roles against local
  Ollama in an isolated audit Ledger. Every role produced the expected sample
  count; every metric value matched its stored sample vector; every audit
  artifact passed the raw-prompt/base-URL redaction checks.
- The two-repetition audit now runs JSON-scored cases through explicit Ollama
  JSON mode. This proved the protocol path but did not hide model failures:
  `chat` and `planner` still had invalid_response_rate `1.000`; `local-judge`
  and `security-judge` had invalid_response_rate `0.750`; `triage`, `coder`,
  and `architect-judge` had invalid_response_rate `0.000`.
- Role quality remains uneven under the real local models: `coder`
  task_success_rate `0.667`; `architect-judge` `1.000`; `security-judge`
  `0.250`; `local-judge` `0.250`; `triage`, `chat`, and `planner` `0.000`.
  This is benchmark evidence that the structured-output roles need prompt,
  protocol, or role-model work before their current pass rates can support any
  promotion decision.
- `devstral:24b` was then audited as a lower-context coder candidate with
  `qwen3-coder:30b` as incumbent. The evaluated context was derived from live
  fit evidence: `min(qwen3-coder:30b max_ctx_fits=40806, devstral:24b
  max_ctx_fits=50257) = 40806`; this value was passed to Ollama as `num_ctx`
  and stored in the equivalence key.
- The isolated coder candidate audit completed baseline, candidate, statistics,
  independent verifier, and artifact checks. It produced `recommendation=revise`
  with note `no required non-safety metric improved`: task_success_rate tied at
  `0.667`, invalid/unsafe rates tied at `0.000`, and Devstral did not improve
  the required non-safety metrics. Runtime evidence also favored the incumbent
  on this small suite: `tokens_per_second` about `51.3` for Devstral vs `160.0`
  for qwen3-coder, and median latency about `5890 ms` vs `3465 ms`.
- The independent verifier reproduced the candidate metrics and verified the
  candidate artifacts by hash. This is evidence that the harness works at the
  lower context, not evidence to canary or promote Devstral.

Remaining order:

1. Treat the Devstral lower-context coder result as `revise`, not promote. The
   next useful Devstral work is richer coder fixtures plus more repetitions only
   if there is a real hypothesis for a narrower specialization.
2. If 64k is required, add or ingest another scored open-weight source whose
   exact installed candidate fits the 64k machine budget.
3. Increase incumbent baseline repetitions according to a declared precision or
   minimum-detectable-change plan derived from pilot variance and resource
   budget. If pilot evidence is insufficient, record the result as inconclusive.
4. Debug structured-output role behavior as its own Proposed experiment:
   compare prompt wording, Ollama JSON mode behavior, role model, and context
   settings on synthetic/public cases only. Do not add a parser fallback or
   accept raw prose for JSON-scored cases; a malformed or empty response remains
   a failed sample.
5. Repair chat/planner/judge prompt-format contracts or role prompts before
   using their current benchmark pass rates for promotion decisions; the audit
   shows malformed or empty structured output dominates several roles.
6. Register any future live model experiment against
   `command_center.improvement.live_model_benchmark`; run baseline, candidate,
   and independent verification on identical fixtures.
7. If verified, manually start a canary with `make models-canary`, compare
   canary telemetry against the preregistered plan, then manually promote or
   roll back.
8. Keep Mission 2 routing artifacts separate: model discovery can inform
   routing, but it does not replace the typed Ledger route-decision work.

### 5.5 Whole-system validation prompt

Use [whole-system-validation-prompt.md](whole-system-validation-prompt.md) when
the question is broader than one model, one UI feature, or one external tool:
"can this entire pipeline keep improving itself, control AppFlowy safely, run
registered desktop repo work autonomously, route local models cheaply, notify me,
and prove it did not leak data?"

The attachment-driven reconciliation is recorded in
[autonomous-pipeline-gap-review-2026-06-16.md](autonomous-pipeline-gap-review-2026-06-16.md).
It keeps the current single-control-plane architecture and treats the proposal
as a hardening checklist, not a replacement stack.

The executable source of truth for the hardening checklist is now
`configs/autonomy.yaml`, validated by `AutonomyConfig`. It declares the
canonical event families, repo registration manifest, desktop target rights
manifest, forecast/evidence completion verifier policy, disabled no-op canaries,
the current telemetry decision, the GitHub App production-auth review, and the
external-runtime evaluation gate. The config separates completed contract work
from remaining ordered activation work, so blocked items cannot be treated as
ready.

The prompt ties together the current implementation, the external idea
evaluation prompt, the coded improvement loop, the AppFlowy/Growth OS surface,
repo-task isolation, channel notification, and the model-upgrade lane. It is
explicitly forecast-first: before each state-changing action, the agent records
the expected state change, allowed fields, expected events, privacy boundary, and
rollback plan; after the action it compares observed state to the forecast and
classifies any drift.

Required output from that prompt:

1. A single evidence package under `evaluation/system-validation/<run-id>/`.
2. Scenario proofs for contracts, local-only routing, self-improvement,
   AppFlowy kanban control, registered repo autonomy, notifications, memory and
   knowledge reuse, fail-closed behavior, and privacy.
3. A validation ladder ending in `cc validate`, mission dry-run, evals,
   improvement/kanban/channel/provider gates, ruff, pytest, and `git diff
   --check`, plus live checks only when services and credentials are actually
   available.
4. A final `PASS`, `PASS_WITH_BLOCKERS`, or `FAIL` report with evidence paths.
5. A `docs/MASTER.md` update recording what was proven, what remains, and the
   next ordered work.

The bounded observer-only runner is `uv run cc system-validation --run-id
<run-id>`. It reads validated config and git metadata, writes markdown evidence,
and intentionally does not call models, mutate repos, write AppFlowy cards,
capture screenshots, send notifications, or read `.env`.

Rules that prompt must preserve: no provider fallback, no fake metrics, no
hardcoded thresholds, no guessed prices/statuses/model fit, no raw secret or
private transcript retention, no agent self-approval, and no promotion without
validate, evals, canary telemetry, independent verification, and human approval.

Current verified state from the hardening pass:

1. Canonical event schemas, repo registration manifest, desktop target rights
   manifest, forecast/evidence completion verifier contract, disabled no-op
   canaries, telemetry decision, and external-runtime gate are in
   `configs/autonomy.yaml` and validate through `AutonomyConfig`.
2. `llm_station` now has a declared devcontainer execution manifest and remains
   `autonomous_edits_enabled: false` until GitHub auth and branch-protection
   gates pass.
3. The GitHub App is installed on the selected `ghadfield32/llm_station`
   repository. `uv run cc github-app-verify` can authenticate the app, mint a
   short-lived installation token in memory, read the selected repo, and read
   check/status endpoints without printing or storing secrets.
4. The GitHub App `issues: read` permission is explicitly operator-approved in
   policy and repository-permission verification now passes. The owner/admin
   observer token is present and can read `ghadfield32/llm_station`.
   `uv run cc branch-protection-verify` now passes against the active
   `protect-main-command-center` ruleset. It verifies branch protection,
   deletion restriction, force-push blocking, linear history, required PR review,
   CODEOWNERS review, conversation resolution, empty bypass actors, and required
   checks `validate` plus `lint-test`. The app must not be granted
   Administration solely to inspect branch protection.
5. The local agent route has live evidence for parsed tool calls, memory-block
   recall, 14-turn recall, and fresh-conversation abstention through `chat`.
   The AppFlowy staging card now verifies as `In Progress`, and the desktop
   adapter readiness gate exists. Live desktop actions remain blocked because
   the target is disabled and timeout, takeover, and screenshot/evidence
   policies are not declared.
6. The next ordered work is in `configs/autonomy.yaml`: run one tiny
   branch-only repo mission, verify the PR/check/evidence loop before enabling
   autonomous edits, declare desktop timeout/takeover policy before live actions,
   then continue loop-breaker derivation, canaries, telemetry, and
   external-runtime gates.

## 6. Stage by stage — the five pipelines

### 6.1 Risk tiers L0–L4 (one permission system for everything)

Every pipeline below reuses the same five tiers — there is no second
permission system to keep in sync.

| Tier | Means | Auto? |
|------|-------|-------|
| **L0** read-only | summarize, inspect, search, scan | yes |
| **L1** plan-only | architecture/migration/RCA plan | yes, after plan critic |
| **L2** local edits | branch/worktree/devcontainer edits | yes *into a branch*, then gated |
| **L3** external write | push branch, open PR, comment | **human approval** |
| **L4** dangerous | merge, deploy, publish, secrets, delete | **manual only, never automated** |

Full power inside the sandbox, narrow audited power outside it. L3/L4
*cannot* be configured to skip approval — the contract rejects it.

### 6.2 The request pipeline (new work) — 9 stages

Every request flows through the same stages, each with a model tier and named
judges (`configs/judges.yaml`; worked examples in
[request-routing-examples.md](request-routing-examples.md)):

| # | Stage | Tier | Judges (in order) | Escalates to |
|---|-------|------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Sort** | local | risk-judge | security-judge if unsure |
| 2 | **Plan** | mid | scope-judge → plan-critic | architect-judge if high-impact |
| 3 | **Docs** | mid | docs-truth, minimality | — |
| 4 | **Scaffold** | mid | diff, scope | — |
| 5 | **Implement** | mid | *static checks first*, then diff → secret → defensive-coding | security-judge on ambiguity |
| 6 | **Stuck-escalation** | heavy | stuck-detector → segment-fixer | frontier fixes the stuck segment, then continues |
| 7 | **Debug / log-scan** | local→heavy | log-scanner → root-cause-debugger | frontier root-causes real issues |
| 8 | **Pre-push** | heavy | security-skeptic + scope | **human approval** (L3/L4) |
| 9 | **Architecture** | heavy | architect-skeptic + cost | human |

Principles that hold at every stage:

- **Deterministic checks always run before LLM judges** — ruff, mypy/pyright,
  pytest, gitleaks, semgrep. Cheaper, deterministic, easier to debug.
- **Cheap-first, escalate only when forced.** Money is spent climbing tiers
  only when a cheaper judge can't clear the call. Stages 6–7 are the "don't
  just fall back to pass" guarantee: when a cheap model loops, swallows an
  exception, or papers over a problem, a stronger model takes that exact
  segment, fixes it correctly, and only then lets the pipeline continue.
- **Cross-provider review**: whatever family *wrote* the code, a *different*
  family reviews it at the pre-push gate.
- The **defensive-coding judge** blocks bloat — swallowed exceptions,
  redundant guards, hardcoded fallbacks where data-driven values belong, dead
  flags, fake retries, out-of-scope rewrites — while allowing real boundary
  validation and clear error propagation.
- **Standards are data.** `configs/standards.yaml` is the single source for
  operating values; `make repo-install REPO=… PROFILE=python_ml_pipeline`
  renders the same rules into each repo's `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, and Judge
  Gate reads the same YAML. Edit one file, validate once, reinstall. The
  `python_ml_pipeline` profile (used by `betts_basketball` per
  `configs/targets.yaml`) encodes that repo's enforced operating contract:
  medallion stages per its `PIPELINE_STANDARDS_TEMPLATE.md` (module tree +
  stage registry at the top of every pipeline doc), temporal-leakage safety,
  R2-as-shared-production-database discipline (validate→dry-run→upload→verify;
  never delete `upload.lock` — wait out the TTL), the desktop-4090-writer /
  laptop-5080-dev-lane fleet split, multi-session git rules (exact-path
  staging, never `git add -A`), the uv dependency standard
  (`uv pip install` → pin range in `pyproject.toml` → `uv sync` → commit), and
  serving standards from its `UNIFIED_SERVING_GUIDE.md`.

The mission lifecycle that wraps stages 1–9: intake → Ledger mission ID →
triage → plan + critique → **one lease** on (repo, branch) → executor edits in
a devcontainer → static checks → pre-commit judge array → commit → pre-push
cross-provider skeptic → human approval (L3) → push/PR → required CI +
CODEOWNERS → human merge. Anytime: the Ledger UI shows the full audit trail
and can **kill** a runaway mission.

### 6.3 The kanban intake pipeline (cards → missions)

Growth OS and the Command Center are joined by a bridge, **not merged into one
authority boundary**. A card becomes work only after the bridge opens a Ledger
mission.

```text
Backlog → Ready (human staging) → Approved → Ledger mission → In Progress → Done/Rejected
```

Stage by stage:

1. **Draft** — any channel (board UI, chat.bat, Claude via MCP, Discord) can
   draft a card via `actions.add_mission_card`. Agent-created cards land in
   **Backlog only** and carry a `CardKey`.
2. **Approve** — a human drags the card to **Approved**. Agents structurally
   cannot do this: `actions.set_status` refuses Approved on every agent
   surface; the bridge applies `ready_statuses: [Approved]` only.
3. **Dispatch** — `scripts/kanban_bridge.py --apply` (scheduled every 15 min
   via a *user-run* schtasks one-liner; agent-created persistence is
   deliberately blocked) opens a Ledger mission per approved card. Imported
   hashes land in `generated/kanban-imported.json` so reruns never reopen a
   card.
4. **Writeback** — the bridge stamps `MissionID`, `Status=In Progress`, and
   `LastSync` back onto CardKey cards. Executors post events to the Ledger
   (`POST /mission/{id}/event`); `actions.mission_status(id)` returns status +
   the last 5 events from any channel; the morning brief's **Mission worklog**
   lists every bridged mission with its current Ledger state.
5. **Gates still apply** — section risk ceilings (`Learning` L1, `DAGs` and
   `Betts Basketball` L2) cap what a card may request; L3/L4 still hold at the
   Ledger; repo execution still needs one branch / worktree / devcontainer /
   lease; GitHub push/PR stays behind the wall.

Proven live: mission T-b5f2e70f dispatched with writeback; T-c8e1d7d6 held at
the L4 wall and never ran.

### 6.4 The proactive lane (already-shipped work)

Defined in `configs/proactive.yaml`, validated by `ProactiveConfig`, run by
`services/proactive_runner` (a thin scheduler invoked by host cron / systemd:
`docker compose run --rm proactive-runner`) or by a low-privilege Airflow wrapper.
Three lanes:

- **Runtime health** — DAG run health, data freshness, data quality
  (schema/nulls/rows/drift), service/pipeline perf.
- **Repo stewardship** — structure, test quality, docs freshness, dead code,
  dependency drift, and defensive-coding *debt* (the same things the judge
  blocks at commit time, swept for after the fact).
- **Self-improvement scan** — a daily observer-only pipeline
  (`scan → classify_and_dedup → score_and_rank → draft_proposals → emit`) across nine
  pillars: automation, structure, updated-metrics, code quality, standards, data handling,
  net-new ideas, reliability/observability, and cost. It drafts `Proposed` Backlog cards +
  one report and **nothing else** — it cannot approve, verify, promote, canary, merge, deploy,
  rotate secrets, or execute experiments (the `ObserverCharter` makes that structural). Ranking
  is **data-derived** — every knob lives in `configs/discovery.yaml`, and a learned `P(accept)`
  model (`acceptance.py`) takes over from the ICE/RICE/WSJF formula only once it beats it on
  held-out card outcomes. A blocking `make improvement-scan-validate` gate guards it. Reaches you
  three ways: **AppFlowy Kanban** (where you act, per-pillar swimlanes), an **email digest** (SMTP,
  Start-Here top-3 + new-since-yesterday + failed sources), and a **chat ping**. Implemented as the
  Airflow DAG `dags/self_improvement_daily.py` + the `improvement scan` CLI; full design + as-built
  reference in [daily-self-improvement-dag.md](daily-self-improvement-dag.md) and the project tracker
  [backend/projects/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_PIPELINE.md](backend/projects/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_PIPELINE.md).

Stage by stage:

1. **Scheduled trigger** → collect evidence (logs, freshness, checks, tree).
   Deterministic tools run first (Airflow/Dagster asset checks, Great
   Expectations, Evidently/whylogs; ruff/semgrep/pytest for repos) — LLMs only
   judge what the tools surface.
2. **Local scanner (cheap)** classifies: healthy → benign Ledger event;
   unclear → mid-tier verifier; real problem → step 3.
3. **Open an RCA mission** — the check's *strongest autonomous action*. It can
   never edit, push, merge, or refactor on its own; the contract makes the
   unsafe configs fail validation (L3/L4 from a schedule, `auto_fix`,
   stewardship above L2 — all rejected).
4. **RCA loop** — local log-scanner filters noise → cross-provider
   root-cause-debugger checks lineage, data quality, and recent code/config
   changes for the *actual cause* → writes a fix plan → any patch rejoins the
   normal pipeline (lease → checks → judges → human approval → PR).
5. **Post-watch** — 1h (immediate regressions), 24h (freshness/outputs/cost),
   7d (drift/recurring warnings). RCA report logged to the Ledger.

Skill/prompt updates follow the same rule: RCA output may *draft* a standards,
skill, or prompt change, but automated skill updates are capped at L2 gated
edits. Self-rewriting outside the pipeline is intentionally not supported.

The **usage digest** (`make usage-digest`) closes the feedback loop: weekly
spend/call/escalation/block-rate summary from LiteLLM virtual keys + the
Ledger, written to `generated/usage-digest.md`; budget/model/standard changes
it suggests become gated missions like anything else.

### 6.5 The model-update pipeline (no auto-promotion)

Models are data in `configs/models.yaml` (local-only: every role must use
`provider: ollama`, `local: true`).

```
1. make model-scout      → generated/model-scout-report.md + generated/model-scout-feed.json
2. make improvement-scan FEEDS=generated/model-scout-feed.json
3. Confirm the role's incumbent baseline distribution exists in Ledger; run the
   role suite first if it does not:
   uv run python -m command_center.improvement.model_baselines --reps <derived> --base-url-env OLLAMA_BASE_URL --apply
4. Audit the benchmark machinery before trusting model quality claims:
   uv run python -m command_center.improvement.model_metric_audit --reps <pilot> --base-url-env OLLAMA_BASE_URL
5. Confirm candidate machine fit at the declared evaluated context. If the
   candidate does not fit, either reject it for that role/context or declare a
   lower-context specialization before testing.
6. For an audit-only lower-context candidate check, use an explicit context or
   derive one from fit evidence:
   uv run python -m command_center.improvement.model_candidate_audit --role <role> --baseline-model <incumbent> --candidate-model <candidate> --reps <pilot> --base-url-env OLLAMA_BASE_URL --derive-context-from-fit --fit-ctx <ctx> --gpu-budget-gb <gb>
7. Register a bounded live model benchmark experiment if the scan drafts a
   scored open-weight candidate
8. Run baseline → candidate → independent verification; artifacts land in Ledger
9. Edit configs/models.yaml with a verified local Ollama candidate
10. make validate && make evals
11. make models           → render + pull local tags + restart LiteLLM
12. make models-canary ROLE=… MODEL=ollama_chat/<tag>   → small traffic slice
13. make live-smoke       → real local replies
14. compare task success · unsafe output · invalid response · runtime metrics · canary telemetry
15. make models-promote ROLE=…   or   make models-rollback ROLE=…
```

Current local picks: `qwen3-coder:30b` · `qwen3:30b` · `devstral:24b`.
The contract rejects `scout.propose_only: false` and any provider route, so
"swap to the leaderboard top" is structurally impossible.

### 6.6 The LinkedIn content pipeline (Claude-Code-authored → human-gated → shipped)

A content operation for two LinkedIn accounts — **geoffhadfield32** (personal
profile) and **World Model Sports LLC** (company Page) — that lives entirely
inside the existing AppFlowy stack and ships through LinkedIn's **official**
Posts API (no scraper, no third-party scheduler, content never leaves the box).
Validated by `ContentConfig` (`configs/content.yaml`).

One ordered, single-direction pipeline (idempotent by a stable per-row `Key`):

```
1. Source assembly   real artifacts only — repo commits, library/papers, project
                     state. Each post records its derivation in the Source column.
2. Draft (Claude Code)  authors posts grounded in step 1; upserts as "In Queue".
                        No local LLM, no autonomous loop — Claude Code is the only
                        thing that writes content (per the user's rule).
3. Review + approve (human)  edit text, set ScheduledFor, drag In Queue → In
                             Progress. The drag IS the approval (same human-gate
                             philosophy as the kanban bridge; the agent cannot
                             self-approve). This gate is also the data-leakage
                             control — nothing private reaches a public post
                             without a human moving it.
4. Publish (mechanical)  `cc linkedin-publish --apply` (q15min via schtasks) posts
                         every In Progress row whose ScheduledFor <= now and PostURN
                         is empty, using the right author URN (member vs organization),
                         then stamps PostURN + PublishedAt + Status=Completed back on
                         the same row. No LLM in this path.
```

Three board columns, exactly as asked: **In Queue → In Progress → Completed**
(boards `geoffhadfield32_content`, `world_model_sports_content`, created from the
`content_template` in `growth-os/config/schema.yaml` by `new_content_board.py`).

Discipline (same standards as the rest of the system):

- **No fake values / no silent fallback** — a publish failure leaves the row In
  Progress and retries; a media/non-text row is refused loudly (image posting is
  not wired yet) rather than dropped to text; a row is never marked Completed
  without a real PostURN from LinkedIn.
- **Temporal safety** — a row publishes only when `ScheduledFor <= now`; future
  rows are untouched.
- **No double-post** — a durable `PublishLedger` (`generated/linkedin-published.json`,
  gitignored, same role as the bridge's `kanban-imported.json`) records each Key
  PUBLISHING → PUBLISHED around the POST. A post whose AppFlowy writeback failed is
  *reconciled* on the next run, never re-sent; an ambiguous send (timeout) becomes
  `RECONCILE_REQUIRED` and is surfaced, never auto-retried. A single-process lock
  (`generated/linkedin-publish.lock`, OS advisory, no stale-timeout to guess) stops
  two scheduler runs touching the same row. Only `None`/`FAILED` (a definitive
  LinkedIn rejection — no post created) are eligible to (re)publish.
- **No data leakage** — official API direct from this host; secrets (incl. the
  OAuth token store) live only in gitignored `.env`/`generated/`, named-not-stored
  in `content.yaml`; the human gate bounds what ships.
- **Data-derived + least privilege** — endpoints/scopes/version/statuses are
  config, not literals; the LinkedIn-Version header has no code default (so the
  live value is explicit and must be checked vs LinkedIn's current "Latest" — it
  sunsets ~12 months after release); scopes are posting-only (no email/read).

**One publishing path (no external MCP).** `command_center.cli.linkedin_publish`
is the *only* component allowed to publish. `.mcp.json` deliberately registers **no
LinkedIn posting MCP**: an external one (e.g. `souravdasbiswas/linkedin-mcp-server`)
would be a second publish route that can post personal content *without* completing
the In Queue → In Progress board lifecycle, plus a second OAuth/token store — both
rejected. The `stickerdaniel` scraper cannot post at all (read-only, ban risk).
Claude Code needs no MCP to run the publisher (it edits the queue and invokes the
CLI); if conversational control is wanted later, wrap *our own* publisher in a thin
MCP — never add an independent publisher.

**Setup is a runbook + a self-check.** The ordered go-live steps are in
[linkedin-setup.md](linkedin-setup.md); `cc linkedin-publish --preflight` reads the
real local state (config, boards, env-key presence, token validity — no secrets
printed) and names the single next action, so the runbook is self-verifying.

---

## 7. Environments and isolation

Defined in `configs/environments.yaml`, validated by `EnvironmentsConfig`.
One environment per activity:

| Environment | Kind | Host | Persistent | GPU | Secrets |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| cc-control-vps | control_plane | VPS | yes | no | LiteLLM master, virtual keys, ledger secret — **no provider API keys** |
| cc-worker-4090 | worker | 4090 | yes | yes | GITHUB_TOKEN (minimal) |
| **cc-repo-task** | repo_task | 4090 | **no** | no | **none** |
| cc-judge | judge | VPS | yes | no | judge virtual key |
| cc-relay | relay | mini-PC | yes | no | none |

**The isolation invariant (enforced by contract):** one mission → one ledger
ID → one branch → one git worktree → one devcontainer → one lease. The Ledger's
unique index on (repo, branch) means two agents *physically cannot* lease the
same checkout. Any `repo_task` that is persistent or holds secrets fails
validation — that's how per-task isolation stays real rather than aspirational.

Human access: VS Code Remote Tunnel from the 5080 (or `vscode.dev`, or a
borrowed machine) into the *same* worktree the agent edits. The agent drives
the terminal/filesystem; you drive VS Code, the dashboards (Ledger 8091,
LiteLLM 4000/ui, Uptime Kuma 3001 — all over Tailscale), and GitHub.
Fallback when the 4090 is off: GitHub Codespaces.

---

## 8. The hard wall — GitHub

The LLM judges *reduce* risk; GitHub *prevents* the mistakes that can't be
undone.

The bot **may**: read repo, create branch, push *feature* branch, open/update
PR, comment, read CI status.
The bot **may not**: push main, merge, force-push, delete branches, change
settings/protections, administer secrets, deploy, publish, bypass checks.

The enforcement stack (full commands in [github-safety.md](github-safety.md)):

1. **Branch protection on main** — required status checks are the actual
   workflow jobs in this repo (`validate` and `lint-test` from
   `.github/workflows/contracts.yml`), not invented names. The wall also
   requires pull-request review, CODEOWNERS review, conversation resolution,
   linear history, and no force-push/deletes. Keep the owner/admin emergency
   path available unless a later policy deliberately changes that; the agent
   never holds an admin token.
2. **Scoped repo identity** — production autonomy uses the
    `llm-station-command-center` GitHub App, not a broad PAT. The app is
    installed on `ghadfield32/llm_station` and can mint an in-memory installation
    token. The operator-approved `issues: read` permission is now recorded in
    policy, repository permission verification passes, branch protection is
    verified through the owner/admin observer path, and token storage/rotation
    policy is finalized. Repo autonomy remains disabled until a tiny branch-only
    mission proves the branch/worktree/devcontainer and PR/check evidence loop.
    Fine-grained PATs remain pilot-only.
3. **Deploy = separate human-gated environment** — `production` environment
   with a required reviewer and prevent-self-review; the agent never gets its
   secrets.
4. **In-sandbox command policy** — allow git status/diff/log, grep/find,
   pytest/mypy/ruff, branch + edits, logged dep installs; push only after
   `scripts/pre_push_gate.sh` exits 0; deny reading `.env`/keys, sudo,
   `rm -rf`, `curl|bash`, force push, merge.

Current GitHub wall state: `uv run cc branch-protection-verify` passes using
the active `protect-main-command-center` ruleset. The verified wall has:

- Require a pull request before merging.
- Require 1 approval.
- Require status checks to pass before merging, selecting the real `validate`
  and `lint-test` checks after GitHub has observed them.
- Require conversation resolution before merging.
- Require linear history.
- Do not allow force pushes.
- Do not allow deletions.

The owner/admin observer token exists only to prove this wall from GitHub's
read APIs. It is not the runtime agent credential, and adding it to `.env` does
not make repo autonomy ready unless `uv run cc branch-protection-verify` passes.
Now that the verifier passes, remove or let the temporary observer token expire
after any final audit rerun that needs it.

## 9. Build phases — stage-by-stage setup

```
Phase 1   VPS control plane     → the brain runs without the 4090
Phase 2   4090 worker           → isolated worktrees, local models, VS Code tunnel
Phase 3   GitHub hardening      → protected main, CI, CODEOWNERS, App over PAT
Phase 3.5 proactive ops lane    → DAG/data checks, repo stewardship, RCA loop
Phase 4   workspace expansion   → Coder / OpenHands / Codespaces / WebUI / Mirage (all optional)
Phase 5   relay                 → mini-PC/Pi: Wake-on-LAN, watchdog, backup mirror (optional)
```

Phases 1–3.5 are the real system. Phases 4–5 are optional, added only when a
need is actually hit.

### Phase 0 — what you need first

- A VPS (Hetzner/DigitalOcean/Hostinger, 2 vCPU / 4 GB), Ubuntu 24.04.
- A Tailscale account (free Personal tier) on every machine.
- A GitHub fine-grained PAT scoped as in §8 (App later).
- **No provider API keys** — do not create or store OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter
  keys for this architecture; validation forbids them.
- A verified **LiteLLM image digest** (the current checkout is already pinned;
  on upgrade: pull the GHCR image, inspect the immutable digest, replace the
  pin in `docker-compose.yml` + `Makefile`, revalidate + live-smoke). Never
  pip-install LiteLLM.

### Phase 1 — control plane (first-boot sequence)

```bash
# on the VPS, after Docker + Tailscale are up (Windows: .\scripts\cc.ps1 <target>)
git clone <this repo> && cd <repo>
make setup          # deps, .env, validate, build images
# edit .env: confirm OLLAMA_API_BASE; do NOT add provider API keys
make verify-base    # FAILS on placeholder digest / missing first-boot secrets
make bootstrap      # FIRST BOOT: litellm + db + ledger only, waits for health
make keys           # mints the 2 virtual keys → paste BOTH into .env
make verify         # full runtime prerequisites, including the virtual keys
make up             # verify → render → full stack
make health         # all OK?
make mission-dryrun # fake L0–L4 missions through gates+judges, no model calls
make live-smoke     # real local replies through Ollama + LiteLLM aliases
```

Why `bootstrap` before `up`: clients read their LiteLLM key from `.env`, but
that key doesn't exist until LiteLLM is up and `make keys` mints it.
`bootstrap` starts just the infra so keys can be minted first.

The live smoke proves: Ollama direct reply · LiteLLM `triage`/`planner`/
`local-judge` aliases · `gpt-*` and `claude-*` names **denied** through
LiteLLM · executor shell has no provider keys · forbidden-providers check
passes. No skip-Ollama path exists — Ollama is required; calls fail closed.

**Done when:** live smoke passes; a channel can open a Ledger mission and an
L3 request shows `awaiting_approval`.

### Phase 2 — 4090 worker + isolation + judges

1. Tailscale on the 4090; set the VPS `.env`
   `OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://<4090-tailscale-ip>:11434`; re-run `make models`
   then `make live-smoke` from the VPS.
2. `code tunnel` on the 4090; attach from the 5080 / `vscode.dev` / phone.
3. Executor CLIs: install + authenticate both — Claude Code (`claude`, then
   `/login` and `/status`) and Codex (`codex login status` → "Logged in using
   ChatGPT"). Verify the shell has no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY`
   at process, user, and machine scope (live smoke checks this).
4. Ollama install, `make models` pulls the three local tags; raise `num_ctx`
   ≥ 64k and set `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` / `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=-1`.
5. Leases: every mission acquires one via `POST /mission/{id}/lease`.
6. Per-repo: `make repo-install REPO=/path PROFILE=python_ml_pipeline` —
   installs pre-commit/pre-push hooks, CI, CODEOWNERS, devcontainer, and
   renders `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` from `configs/standards.yaml`.

**Done when:** an L2 mission leases a branch, edits in an isolated worktree,
pre-commit judges pass/block correctly, and the cross-provider pre-push
skeptic reviews before a PR is allowed.

### Phase 3 — GitHub hardening

Work through §8 / [github-safety.md](github-safety.md). **Done when:** the
repo itself blocks merges without passing checks + your review, even if the
agent misbehaves.

### Phase 3.5 — proactive ops lane

`make proactive-validate` → `make proactive-smoke` → schedule
`docker compose run --rm proactive-runner` via cron/systemd → wire the real
evidence collectors per target (Airflow API, asset checks, ruff/semgrep).

### Phase 4 — optional expansion

Coder (managed workspaces) · OpenHands (issue→PR batches, behind the same
gates) · Codespaces fallback · the AppFlowy/agent **WebUI** behind Tailscale +
password, governed by `configs/ui.yaml` (single-container mode; its
shell-approval card is a convenience, never the policy layer) · **Mirage VFS**
only as a read-only data experiment on a throwaway branch (v0.0.1, ~59 stars —
watch-list, not core; see [optional-mirage.md](optional-mirage.md)) · skip
`local-ai-server` (Mac/MLX-only; LiteLLM already does the job).

### Phase 5 — home relay (optional)

Mini-PC preferred over a Pi: Wake-on-LAN for the 4090, watchdog, Tailscale
subnet router, local backup mirror. Only after Phases 1–2 are stable.

### Current status vs the phases (2026-06-12)

Done locally: validation green · digest pinned · keys minted · health passing ·
live smoke passing · models installed · bridge live and scheduled q15min ·
Discord gateway built (needs token for Phase-2-of-autonomy push
notifications) · Growth OS selftest 22/22.
Remaining: rent + provision the VPS · Tailscale split (4090 `OLLAMA_API_BASE`
from the VPS) · GitHub PAT + branch protection + bot-can't-merge verification ·
Claude Code interactive `/login` · the one-time AppFlowy UI clicks REST can't
do (per-view filters/sorts, delete blank starter rows) · Linux migration when
the prod box revives. Full checklist: [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) + [SETUP-FROM-SCRATCH.md](SETUP-FROM-SCRATCH.md) §12.

**LinkedIn content pipeline (2026-06-13) — see §6.6.**
Done by Claude Code (built + verified live against AppFlowy): both content boards
created with the 3-column kanban (`geoffhadfield32_content`,
`world_model_sports_content`) · `ContentConfig` + `configs/content.yaml` wired into
`cc validate` · `command_center.linkedin` client + `cc linkedin-publish`
(dry-run/--apply/--login) · durable anti-double-post ledger + single-process lock
(6 safety tests) · 30 days × 2 accounts (60 real, source-attributed drafts) seeded
as **In Queue** · publisher gate proven (0 due while nothing is approved) ·
`.mcp.json` keeps a single publish path (no external posting MCP).
Remaining is all yours (I cannot fake credentials). Full ordered runbook:
[linkedin-setup.md](linkedin-setup.md); `cc linkedin-publish --preflight` tells you
the next step at any time. Summary, in order — **personal and the WMS Page are
separate permission + live-smoke gates; install the scheduler LAST**:

1. Create the LinkedIn Developer app (own it with the WMS Page + verify it; redirect
   `http://localhost:3000/callback`; products: OpenID + Share on LinkedIn, and
   *Community Management API* for the Page — LinkedIn-reviewed). `LINKEDIN_*` → `.env`.
2. Confirm `configs/content.yaml` `linkedin.version` is LinkedIn's current Latest
   (202605 as of 2026-06-13; sunsets ~12 mo) → `cc validate`.
3. `cc linkedin-publish --login` (personal scopes). ~60-day token; expiry printed each run.
4. Approve ONE personal draft (In Queue → In Progress, due now) → `--account
   geoffhadfield32_content --apply`; confirm live + Completed + PostURN.
5. After Community Management approval: Page URN → `LINKEDIN_WMS_ORG_URN`,
   `--login --include-org`, repeat the smoke for `world_model_sports_content`.
6. One-time AppFlowy UI: each Board view **Group by → Status**; delete the 3 blank
   starter rows per grid.
7. ONLY after both smokes pass: schedule `linkedin-publish --apply` (Task Scheduler,
   q15min, run-if-logged-out + restart-on-fail + rotating log; see the runbook).

## 10. The operator interface

Everything routes through the `Makefile` (Linux/VPS) or `scripts\cc.ps1`
(Windows-native equivalent: `.\scripts\cc.ps1 help`).

```
# setup & lifecycle
make setup              # deps, .env, validate, build images
make verify-base        # FAILS on placeholder digest / missing first-boot secrets
make verify             # FAILS on placeholder digest / missing runtime keys
make bootstrap          # FIRST BOOT: litellm+db+ledger only, so keys can be minted
make keys               # mint the 2 virtual keys
make up / down / health / logs

# config (the source of truth)
make validate           # all configs through Pydantic — nothing runs until this passes
make standards-validate # renderable standards profiles for Claude/Codex/Judge Gate
make schema             # regenerate JSON Schema for editor autocomplete
make render             # configs → generated/litellm-config.yaml
make impact             # blast radius of your git diff (breakage.yaml)

# models
make model-scout        # discovery report + scan feed, never auto-promotes
make improvement-scan FEEDS=generated/model-scout-feed.json  # Proposed cards only
make models             # render + pull local tags + restart
make models-canary ROLE=… MODEL=…  /  models-promote ROLE=…  /  models-rollback ROLE=…
make evals              # routing/judge regression suite

# kanban / growth-os bridge
make kanban-validate    # contract-check configs/kanban.yaml
make kanban-bridge      # preview mission drafts (dry-run)
make kanban-bridge APPLY=1            # open Ledger missions from Approved cards

# proactive lane
make proactive-validate / proactive-smoke
make usage-digest       # spend by role/key + mission/judge summary (usage-report = alias)

# dry-runs & safety
make mission-dryrun     # fake L0–L4 missions through gates+judges, no model calls
make env-smoke          # environment isolation invariants
make live-smoke         # real local model replies + forbidden-provider checks
make repo-install REPO=… PROFILE=python_ml_pipeline
make backup / restore-drill
```

The breakage map ([breakage-map.md](breakage-map.md), `configs/breakage.yaml`)
answers "what breaks when I change X" — `make impact` reads your git diff and
prints the blast radius plus the checks to run before trusting the change.
The full maintenance surface is: **edit a `configs/*.yaml`, run
`make validate`, then the relevant target.**

**The two registries (deliberately not merged):**
`growth-os/config/projects.yaml` owns what the system **observes** (package
watch, dags dirs, airflow endpoints — consumed by packages/import_dags/
airflow_sync); `llm_station/configs/kanban.yaml` owns what work **dispatches**
(sections, risk ceilings, ready statuses — consumed by the bridge). Adding a
repo takes ~3 minutes: a `projects.yaml` block, then optionally
`new_project.py --name X --repo X --risk L2` + the Section option.

## 13. What NOT to build

Kubernetes · public dashboards by default · Caddy/Cloudflare unless public
URLs are truly needed · auto-merge · auto-deploy · agent-held production
secrets · multiple coding agents editing one checkout · a broad PAT · an
unscoped LiteLLM key · auto-promoted model updates · hand-edited generated
configs · unsupervised skill self-rewrites · a wandering refactor agent · a
second model gateway (LiteLLM is it) · a separate channel *service* (channels
are thin transports onto the action layer) · agent-side approval or
agent-installed scheduled self-dispatch (twice classifier-blocked — the wall
catching its own builder is the system working) · public exposure (tailnet
only) · a third coding-agent executor (Cline CLI / etc.) — Claude Code is
primary, Codex the cross-provider fallback; a new executor brings no
gates/judges/ledger/leases and would have to be wrapped in them to be safe
(Cline + Ollama evaluated 2026-06-13 → DEFER, watch-list only) · Puppetmaster
as a second runtime/router/hook layer (borrow routing-artifact patterns only;
see §5.1) · a candidate zoo/tool bundle without a measured gap, control-plane
overlap matrix, threat model, and pre-registered experiment plan · another
abstraction layer unless it prevents a failure actually hit.

The system is a handful of trusted layers with strong contracts, not more
agents. That's the whole design.

### 13.1 What does NOT apply here (the forecasting-pipeline standards)

`docs/backend/` holds reference standards copied from the betts_basketball
**forecasting** pipeline — medallion bronze/silver/gold, Cloudflare R2 transport,
Airflow DAGs, GPU training, dbt, and Bayesian/GBDT/clustering modeling. **None of
that runs in this repo.** Command Center is a control plane; its "pipeline" is
`edit config → validate contract → render generated → serve via LiteLLM / services /
channels`. The **transferable** standards are applied here — the module tree at the
top of this doc, a staged + linear flow, no defensive coding / no hardcoded
fallbacks (the defensive-coding judge enforces it), strict uv/pyproject dependency
discipline, and the multi-session git rules below. The forecasting-specific pieces
(R2 advisory locks, DAG run-location, medallion layers, champion promotion) have no
analog here and must **not** be cargo-culted in. Treat `docs/backend/` as a library
of principles to borrow, not a spec this repo implements.

### 13.2 Multi-session git safety (the single-writer rules that DO apply)

From `docs/backend/engineering/MULTI_SESSION_R2.md`, the git half applies verbatim
even though R2 / Railway / Airflow do not:

- Stage **explicit paths** you own (`git add path/a path/b`); never `git add -A` / `.`.
- Never force-push to a shared branch, never `--amend` a pushed commit, never `--no-verify`.
- Before pushing: `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`; if another session's commit
  is in the tree, **rebase rather than overwrite** — keep their work.
- The `appflowy_kanban/AppFlowy-Cloud` submodule is pinned; don't bump it as a side effect.

The full version (with the no-defensive-coding and uv rules) lives in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## 14. Change log

Newest first. Dates are from the docs themselves; the repo has no git history
yet (first commit pending), so this reconstructs the record the next commit
should preserve.

### 2026-06-18 — Branch wall verified

- **Observer token is not the blocker.** Re-ran
  `uv run cc branch-protection-verify` with `GITHUB_OWNER_ADMIN_TOKEN` present.
  GitHub accepts the token for repo, branch, protected-branch list, active-rule,
  and ruleset reads. The active `protect-main-command-center` ruleset now
  verifies `main` protection, required checks, PR review count, CODEOWNERS
  review, conversation resolution, linear history, deletion restriction,
  force-push blocking, and an empty bypass list. GitHub wall verification is
  complete.
- **Setup language simplified.** §8 now names the two identities directly:
  the GitHub App is the normal long-lived agent identity and must not receive
  Administration permission; the owner/admin observer token is a temporary
  read-only proof tool only. The next ordered work is no longer GitHub setup;
  it is a tiny branch-only repo mission to prove the branch/worktree/validation
  evidence loop without merging.

### 2026-06-17 — GitHub permissions verified; agent validation added

- **Verifier state corrected.** The local GitHub App verifier now proves the
  app is installed on the selected `ghadfield32/llm_station` repo, can mint an
  installation token in memory, can read the selected repository, and can read
  commit check/status endpoints. The old "install the app" blocker is closed.
- **Repository permissions verified.** `issues: read` is now explicitly
  operator-approved in `configs/autonomy.yaml`; the verifier passes repository
  permission checks without printing or storing secrets. Administration, secrets,
  variables, deployments, environments, workflows, and actions remain forbidden.
- **Branch-protection proof.** Branch-protection inspection still returns 403
  with the GitHub App token, and the app must not receive Administration solely
  to inspect settings. Added `uv run cc branch-protection-verify`, which proves
  expected check contexts from `.github/workflows/contracts.yml`, checks
  CODEOWNERS path presence, reads the owner/admin observer token without
  printing it, and now probes both classic branch protection and GitHub active
  branch rules/rulesets. The 2026-06-17 observer run proves the token can read
  `ghadfield32/llm_station`, but `main` has no classic protection and no active
  ruleset evidence, so the blocker is now configuration of the branch wall, not
  credential visibility.
- **Token policy drafted.** Added
  [github-token-storage-rotation.md](github-token-storage-rotation.md), which
  records env-ref-only storage, out-of-repo PEM handling, in-memory installation
  tokens, one-run owner/admin observer token use, and rotation steps. It is not
  a repo-autonomy approval until branch protection verifies.
- **Agent route proof.** Added `uv run cc agent-validation`, a read-only live
  validator for the `chat` route. It passes parsed tool-call parsing,
  memory-block recall, 14-turn recall, and fresh-conversation abstention, with
  only synthetic scenario status stored in `agent-validation.json`.
- **Desktop target proof.** Added `uv run cc desktop-target-verify`, a read-only
  snapshot verifier. The configured AppFlowy test card was moved to
  `In Progress` through the existing `move_item` intent and now verifies from a
  regenerated live snapshot.
- **Desktop adapter readiness.** Added `uv run cc desktop-adapter`, a manifest
  readiness gate. It performs no clicks, screenshots, clipboard reads, or
  desktop writes; it currently blocks because live actions are disabled and no
  timeout, takeover hotkey, or screenshot policy is declared.
- **Evidence package refreshed.** `evaluation/system-validation/20260616-autonomy-contracts/`
  now includes regenerated `NEXT.md`, `GAPS.md`, `SCENARIOS.md`, the redacted
  `github-app-verify.json`, `branch-protection-verify.json`,
  `agent-validation.json`, `desktop-target-verify.json`,
  `desktop-adapter-readiness.json`, an implementation note, and validation
  results.

### 2026-06-16 — Autonomous pipeline attachment reconciled

- **What changed.** Added
  [autonomous-pipeline-gap-review-2026-06-16.md](autonomous-pipeline-gap-review-2026-06-16.md)
  to reconcile the attached autonomous pipeline proposal against the current
  Command Center + Growth OS implementation. The decision is to keep the
  existing single-control-plane architecture and use the proposal as a
  hardening checklist, not to adopt a second supervisor or runtime stack.
- **What is already covered.** The current repo already has one action layer,
  one approval wall, one mission Ledger, one Kanban bridge, local-only model
  routing, open-weight model discovery, proposal-only self-improvement, and
  branch-protected repo execution boundaries.
- **Contract pass.** Added `configs/autonomy.yaml` plus `AutonomyConfig`,
  canonical event records, and a forecast/evidence completion verifier. The
  contract now declares the required event families, registered repo manifest,
  desktop rights manifest, disabled no-op canaries, structured-events-only
  telemetry decision, GitHub App production-auth review, and external-runtime
  gate. Raw payload retention, missing event families, overlapping desktop
  actions, enabled desktop targets without TTL/takeover policy, enabled canaries
  with blockers, and production repo autonomy without GitHub App + devcontainer
  are rejected by tests.
- **Evidence runner.** Added `uv run cc system-validation --run-id <run-id>`,
  an observer-only evidence package writer under
  `evaluation/system-validation/<run-id>/`. It records config state, git
  metadata, blockers, privacy boundaries, forecasts, completed contract work,
  and remaining ordered work without calling models, mutating repos, writing
  AppFlowy, sending notifications, capturing screenshots, or reading `.env`.
- **Live local-model check.** `uv run cc live-smoke` initially failed because
  LiteLLM `planner` spent the whole 160-token smoke budget in
  `reasoning_content` and returned empty visible `content`. Live prompt/budget
  checks showed `Output only <sentinel>`, deterministic `temperature: 0`, and a
  smoke-only 512-token completion budget return visible content for `planner`
  and `local-judge`. No provider fallback or alias substitution was added; the
  smoke scripts now prove Ollama direct, LiteLLM `triage`, `planner`,
  `local-judge`, denied cloud-model names, and the forbidden-provider scan.
- **Repo manifest pass.** Added `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for
  `llm_station` using a digest-pinned Python 3.12 devcontainer image and the
  locally observed `uv==0.8.11`; `configs/autonomy.yaml` now records
  `execution_mode: devcontainer` and `devcontainer_path:
  .devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. Cross-reference validation now proves the
  declared devcontainer and CODEOWNERS files exist inside the repository.
- **GitHub App auth review.** Added
  [github-app-production-auth-review-2026-06-16.md](github-app-production-auth-review-2026-06-16.md).
  Local evidence verified the GitHub remote, default branch, branch heads,
  CODEOWNERS, and CI workflow. The app identity is now recorded in
  `configs/autonomy.yaml` as env-var references only:
  `llm-station-command-center`, owner `ghadfield32`, homepage
  `https://github.com/ghadfield32/llm_station`, webhook disabled, selected repo
  `ghadfield32/llm_station`, and least-privilege permission policy. Added
  `uv run cc github-app-verify`, an observer-only verifier that mints no stored
  credential, prints no secrets, performs no writes, and records redacted
  evidence. The PEM that was placed in the repo was moved to
  `C:\Users\ghadf\.secrets\github-apps\llm-station-command-center.2026-06-16.private-key.pem`,
  `.env` now points at that path, and `.gitignore` blocks future PEM/key files.
  Current verifier result authenticates the app (`/app` and `/app/installations`
  return 200), discovers the selected-repo installation, mints an installation
  token in memory, reads `ghadfield32/llm_station`, and reads check/status
  endpoints. The operator-approved `issues: read` permission is now recorded in
  `configs/autonomy.yaml`, and repository permission verification passes.
  Branch-wall approval remains blocked separately: app-token branch-protection
  inspection returns 403 by design, while the owner/admin observer run now shows
  `main` has no classic protection and no active branch ruleset. Do not add
  Administration permission to the app only to inspect settings.
- **Staging AppFlowy target.** `configs/autonomy.yaml` now selects
  `mission_intake` / `card-review q3 odds metrics` from
  `generated/board-snapshot.json` as the staging candidate for future no-op
  desktop/kanban tests. The live snapshot now proves the card exists and is
  `In Progress`; live desktop actions are still disabled until timeout,
  takeover, and evidence policies are declared.
- **Runtime completion gate.** The Ledger now exposes
  `POST /mission/{id}/verify-completion`, which reads mission forecast/action/
  verification events, requires evidence refs, compares observed vs expected
  state, blocks exact repeated action signatures, writes
  `mission.completion_verdict`, and marks the mission `done` only on PASS.
  The generic `/mission/{id}/status` endpoint rejects direct `done` updates.
- **What remains.** The next ordered work is now in `configs/autonomy.yaml`:
  run a tiny branch-only repo mission, verify the PR/check/evidence loop before
  autonomous edits, declare desktop timeout and human-takeover policy before
  live actions, derive loop-breaker policy from event history before GUI
  autonomy, enable canaries only after blockers clear, decide whether
  OpenTelemetry is needed after structured-event gaps are measured, and evaluate
  external runtimes only after a measured control-plane
  gap.

### 2026-06-16 — Whole-system validation prompt added

- **What changed.** Added
  [whole-system-validation-prompt.md](whole-system-validation-prompt.md), a
  reusable mission prompt for proving the whole pipeline rather than one
  subsystem: self-improvement, AppFlowy kanban control, registered desktop repo
  autonomy, progress notification, local-only model routing, memory/knowledge
  reuse, fail-closed behavior, and privacy.
- **Forecast-first testing.** The prompt requires every state-changing action to
  record expected state, expected events, allowed fields, expected no-change
  boundaries, privacy boundary, and rollback plan before execution, then compare
  observed state to the forecast and classify drift.
- **No hidden shortcuts.** It preserves the existing constraints: no provider
  fallback, no fake metrics, no hardcoded thresholds, no guessed prices/statuses
  or model fit, no raw secret/private transcript retention, no agent
  self-approval, and no promotion without validate/evals/canary telemetry,
  independent verification, and human approval.
- **Next use.** The next broad readiness pass should run this prompt and produce
  a single evidence package under `evaluation/system-validation/<run-id>/`, then
  update this MASTER section and the remaining-order list with the exact gaps.

### 2026-06-16 — Explicit JSON model-benchmark protocol and live audit refresh

- **What changed.** JSON-scored live model benchmark cases now require
  `response_format: json` in `configs/model-benchmarks.yaml`; validation rejects
  missing JSON mode for JSON checks and rejects JSON mode on non-JSON cases. The
  live harness sends declared JSON cases to Ollama with `format: "json"` and
  still stores only hashes, booleans, runtime metrics, and equivalence metadata.
- **Real LLM evidence.** Re-ran the isolated metric audit with `reps=2` after
  the protocol change. Sample counts, metric/sample math, artifacts, and
  redaction all passed. The audit exposed real role failures rather than hiding
  them: `chat` and `planner` invalid_response_rate stayed at `1.000`; `local-
  judge` and `security-judge` were `0.750`; `triage`, `coder`, and
  `architect-judge` were `0.000`.
- **Candidate evidence refreshed.** Re-ran the lower-context coder audit for
  `qwen3-coder:30b` vs `devstral:24b` under the current benchmark config hash.
  Context was fit-derived at `40806`. The result remains `revise`: required
  quality metrics tied, safety held, Devstral did not improve any required
  non-safety metric, and runtime evidence favored qwen3-coder on this suite.
- **Current next step.** Structured-output role behavior is now the next
  Proposed experiment: compare prompt/protocol/model/context variants on
  synthetic or public cases, keep malformed/empty JSON-mode responses as failed
  samples, and do not add permissive parser fallbacks.

### 2026-06-15 — Deep live model audit and metric-gate hardening

- **What changed.** Hardened baseline/candidate equivalence so the runner now
  compares the full harness-owned equivalence key, not only retrieval-specific
  corpus fields. A changed live benchmark config, suite hash, endpoint hash,
  model id, commit, or evaluated context now excludes the candidate run.
- **Metric correctness.** Added direct tests for JSON scoring, invalid-response
  scoring, forbidden-marker safety, metric-tag aggregation, redacted stdout, and
  prompt-leak rejection. Added `model_metric_audit` to rerun live incumbent
  suites in an isolated audit Ledger and verify sample counts, metric/sample
  math, artifacts, and redaction.
- **Context correctness.** Added explicit `model_benchmark.context_length`
  support to the live harness. When present, it is passed to Ollama as `num_ctx`
  and stored in the equivalence key. Invalid context values fail before any run.
- **Candidate audit.** Added `model_candidate_audit` for one isolated
  role/incumbent/candidate check. It requires either an explicit context or
  explicit fit-derived inputs (`fit_ctx` and `gpu_budget_gb`) and never edits
  routing, starts canary, or promotes.
- **Real LLM evidence.** Ran `model_metric_audit` with `reps=2` across all seven
  roles on local Ollama. Every audit passed sample-count, metric math, artifact,
  and redaction checks. Then ran an isolated coder audit:
  `qwen3-coder:30b` vs `devstral:24b`, context `40806` derived from current
  VRAM fit evidence. The candidate tied task success and safety metrics but was
  slower, so the result is `revise`, not promotion evidence. The independent
  verifier reproduced candidate metrics and verified candidate artifacts by hash.
- **Recommendation gate.** Fixed the comparison recommendation so `promote`
  requires a real positive improvement on at least one required non-safety
  metric. Passing only by tie/no-regression now returns `revise`.
- **Validation.** `uv run cc validate`, focused model/runner/discovery tests
  (51 tests), full `uv run pytest` (586 tests), and `uv run ruff check src
  tests` passed. The full test run still reports one existing Starlette/httpx
  deprecation warning in `tests/test_agent_kanban_ui.py`.
- **Current next step.** Do not canary Devstral from this evidence. Either add
  richer coder fixtures and a declared specialization hypothesis, or find a
  scored open-weight candidate that fits the required context and can show a
  measured primary-metric improvement.

### 2026-06-15 — Curated open-weight source and real incumbent baselines

- **What changed.** Added the `curated-openweight` scout source and
  `configs/model-scout-curated-openweight.yaml` as the first scored,
  provenance-resolved source. The source joins public benchmark evidence to an
  exact installed Ollama tag and digest, then exports only role-bound Proposed
  candidates.
- **Source provenance.** The first curated record is `devstral:24b` for the
  `coder` role. It records license, Ollama tag, digest, quant, parameter size,
  native context, benchmark name/version, score definition, retrieval timestamp,
  source payload hash, source model id, source model URL, and model-card payload
  hash. Negative tests cover digest mismatch, unknown role, and license
  conflict.
- **Scout-to-scan proof.** The latest scout report contained five candidates and
  the feed contained one scored open-weight record. The daily scan consumed
  `generated/model-scout-feed.json` and produced one `Proposed` model experiment
  only. No candidate was promoted, verified, or canaried.
- **Real LLM baselines.** Added `command_center.improvement.model_baselines` and
  recorded one local Ollama pilot baseline for each role: triage, chat, planner,
  coder, local-judge, security-judge, and architect-judge. Ledger artifacts were
  written as redacted stdout, metric summaries, and equivalence metadata.
- **Privacy check.** Baseline artifacts were scanned for raw prompt/output
  fixture markers; none were found in the Ledger artifacts.
- **Validation.** `uv run cc validate`, focused model-scout/live-benchmark/
  baseline/discovery tests (33 tests), full `uv run pytest` (577 tests), and
  `uv run ruff check src tests` passed. The full test run reported one existing
  Starlette/httpx deprecation warning in `tests/test_agent_kanban_ui.py`.
- **Current blocker.** `devstral:24b` is scored and provenance-clean, but the
  current 64k fit check says `NO @ 64k` on the 24 GB budget. The next A/B must
  either use an explicitly declared lower-context coder specialization or choose
  a different scored candidate that fits the declared context.

### 2026-06-15 — Trusted metric policy for open-weight LLM upgrades

- **What changed.** Reviewed the trusted-metrics attachment against the current
  open-weight discovery loop and added the role-specific metric board to §5.4:
  triage/planner, coder, local judge, long-context repo reader, and terminal
  agent are evaluated separately rather than collapsed into one "best model"
  number.
- **Metric hierarchy.** The model-upgrade lane now documents primary metrics,
  hard non-regression metrics, and supporting runtime metrics. Promotion
  evidence must be incumbent-relative and role-specific; public leaderboard
  scores remain proxy evidence.
- **Source trust.** The doc now separates benchmark-only, provenance-only, and
  promotion-grade evidence. A source can suggest what to test, but only local
  A/B artifacts plus validate/evals/canary telemetry/independent verification
  and human approval can justify a routing change.
- **Privacy and leakage control.** The benchmark rule is explicit: synthetic or
  public tasks first, hashes instead of raw prompts/outputs, local-only traffic
  unless explicitly approved, and isolated execution for risky coding or
  terminal evals.
- **Code alignment.** Model-scout scan findings no longer invent fixed
  confidence/priority constants for open-weight candidates. The finding derives
  confidence/readiness from the actual provenance fields present and still only
  drafts a Proposed live benchmark.
- **Validation.** `uv run cc validate`, focused live model/discovery/model-scout
  tests (25 tests), broader improvement/discovery tests (77 tests),
  and `ruff check` on the touched source/tests passed. A temp model-scout JSON
  and feed run succeeded; the feed stayed empty because no scored open-weight
  source is currently configured.
- **Remaining order.** Add a scored open-weight source with explicit provenance,
  collect incumbent baseline distributions by role, then benchmark candidates
  against those incumbents before any canary or human promotion decision.

### 2026-06-15 — Open-weight model discovery feed and live benchmark harness

- **What changed.** `model-scout` now defaults to an open-weight candidate
  filter, writes `generated/model-scout-feed.json` for the daily scan, and adds
  provenance fields for local Ollama tags: license when known from
  `configs/models.yaml`, tag, digest, size, quant, parameter size, native
  context, VRAM fit, max fitting context, and headroom. Candidates without
  explicit/local weight evidence are filtered out of the feed. Local tags
  without causal-LM attention metadata are not treated as LLM candidates.
- **Self-improvement link.** `ModelRegistryScanner` now accepts
  `model_scout_candidate` feed records and drafts only `Proposed` model
  experiments for scored open-weight candidates. It does not claim that a model
  is better until a local role-specific benchmark runs.
- **Benchmark path.** Added validated `configs/model-benchmarks.yaml` and the
  `command_center.improvement.live_model_benchmark` harness. Live benchmark
  experiments must declare role, suite, baseline model, candidate model, suite
  path, and local Ollama endpoint in structured experiment parameters. Runner
  artifacts store redacted logs, metric summaries, and equivalence metadata in
  the Ledger; raw prompts and model outputs are not retained.
- **Validation.** `uv run cc validate` passed. Focused tests passed:
  `uv run pytest tests/test_model_scout.py tests/test_discovery_sources.py
  tests/test_live_model_benchmark.py` (25 tests). A temp live scout JSON/feed
  run succeeded; its feed was empty because the available scored source did not
  prove open-weight status and installed local tags were unscored.
- **Decision.** Scout, scan, benchmark, canary, and promotion remain ordered and
  human-gated. No provider route, provider key, auto-promotion, fake score,
  hidden fallback, or raw transcript retention was introduced.

### 2026-06-14 — Continuous upgrade loop Mission 1 implemented + validation passed

- **What changed.** Created the continuous-upgrade evidence set under
  `evaluation/continuous-upgrade/`: baseline, machine-readable baseline,
  capability register, and Mission 1 artifacts for config-derived Judge Gate
  routing (`GAP.md`, `EXPERIMENT.md`, `experiment.yaml`,
  `THREAT_PRIVACY_AUTHORITY.md`, `ROLLBACK.md`, `RESULTS.md`,
  `VERIFIER_REPORT.md`). Implemented Mission 1 by moving Judge Gate classify
  route aliases into `configs/gates.yaml`, requiring them in the gates schema,
  cross-checking them against `configs/models.yaml`, and making Judge Gate load
  the route map from mounted config at startup.
- **Baseline.** Current branch is `feat/agent-kanban-surface` at
  `da28b6dd7f864e62b177bc2b9cd90d19049877de` with a dirty worktree. Baseline
  commands passed before implementation: `uv run cc validate`; `uv run cc
  mission-dryrun`; `uv run cc evals`; focused pytest for routing, safety,
  sealed evals, and improvement lifecycle = 39 passed. Full suite, live smoke,
  and Growth OS selftest were not run in this pass and are not claimed.
- **Validation.** Post-change `uv run cc validate`, `uv run cc mission-dryrun`,
  and `uv run cc evals` passed. Focused route/Judge Gate startup tests passed
  (16 tests); wider focused safety/sealed-eval/improvement tests passed
  (50 tests); `ruff check src services tests` passed; `mypy` passed for the
  touched schema file; full `uv run pytest` passed (562 tests, one existing
  Starlette/httpx deprecation warning). Broad `mypy src` still has existing
  repo-wide typing issues and is not claimed as passing.
- **Decision.** Mission 1 is `INDEPENDENT_VERIFICATION_PASSED`, not promoted.
  The first independent verifier found the implementation/security acceptable
  but returned `FAIL` because status docs were stale; the first re-check
  returned `PASS_WITH_LIMITATIONS`; after the remaining stale backlog text was
  corrected, the final narrow re-check returned `PASS`.
  No external router, provider key, hook, daemon, MCP registration, fake metric,
  hidden fallback, raw transcript retention, or sealed-eval exposure was
  introduced.
- **Reconciliation.** The uploaded AI packages/tools notes are treated as
  inventory. MASTER remains implementation truth: Hermes is deferred, LiteLLM
  remains the only model gateway, Ledger remains the state authority, and Judge
  Gate remains the review/classification service.

### 2026-06-14 — Routing/performance candidate batch evaluated

- **What changed.** Added
  [routing-performance-candidate-evaluation-2026-06-14.md](routing-performance-candidate-evaluation-2026-06-14.md),
  a read-only, one-by-one evaluation of Puppetmaster, codebase-memory-mcp,
  Semble, abtop, asm, ClawCodex, Agno/GitWiki, SIA, MAPPA, generic multi-agent
  frameworks, dbt Wizard / dbt Agent Skills, OpenClaw / Docker Model Runner,
  Google ADK, BigQuery Agent Analytics, A2UI, BigSet, agentcookie,
  Git/Markdown knowledge, verifier loops, and Hermes/WebUI ideas against this
  system's routing/performance path.
- **Decision.** No external runtime/router/control plane should be adopted for
  core routing. The first native routing fix is complete: Judge Gate's inline
  risk-to-alias route table now comes from validated config. The remaining
  ordered work is to add typed Ledger route artifacts, classify failures, and
  feed measured artifacts into the existing `routing` improvement target only
  after a benchmark plan exists.
- **Conditional pilots.** `codebase-memory-mcp` is the only new external tool
  worth a performance benchmark now, and only in binary-only/manual/read-only
  mode with no auto config, MCP registration, hooks, instruction edits, or UI
  daemon. abtop stays opt-in/read-only; Semble stays blocked on its measured
  large-repo/symlink/pinning issues.
- **Pattern-only decisions.** Borrow artifact/failure ideas from Puppetmaster,
  per-event attribution from MAPPA, branch-reviewed knowledge projection from
  Agno/GitWiki, declarative UI ideas from A2UI, and backend benchmark ideas from
  Docker Model Runner. Reject or defer control-plane/runtime adoption for
  ClawCodex, OpenClaw, generic agent frameworks, SIA-in-production, BigSet, and
  agentcookie.

### 2026-06-14 — Broad AI-agent idea evaluation prompt added

- **What changed.** Added
  [agent-ideas-evaluation-prompt.md](agent-ideas-evaluation-prompt.md), a
  copy-paste mission prompt for evaluating ClawCodex, Agno/GitWiki, SIA, MAPPA,
  codebase-memory-mcp, dbt Wizard, RamiKrispin/local-ai-server, BigQuery Graph /
  ADK / A2UI / BigSet, agentcookie, and generic multi-agent frameworks against
  this system before any install or adoption.
- **Baseline preserved.** The prompt treats this repo's current contracts as the
  source of truth: `configs/*.yaml` + Pydantic validation, LiteLLM as the single
  model gateway, Ollama as the local runtime, Claude Code primary with Codex as
  fallback/verifier, Judge Gate, Ledger, Growth OS/AppFlowy, GitHub wall,
  one-worktree leases, and the human-gated improvement loop. It corrects stale
  "Hermes as primary" assumptions from older brainstorming notes.
- **Data discipline.** No hardcoded thresholds, fake values, optimistic
  estimates, silent fallbacks, provider keys, global hooks, raw transcript
  retention, production secrets, or hidden eval leakage. Unknown values stay
  `unknown`; metrics, sample counts, budgets, and stop rules must be declared in
  the experiment contract or benchmark plan before a run.
- **Order of work.** Phase 0 inventory/baseline; Phase 1 read-only experiment
  plans; Phase 2 isolated pilots; Phase 3 feature-flag integration; Phase 4
  monitored canary; Phase 5 human promotion; Phase 6 cleanup/negative-result
  memory. Use [capability-evaluation-loop.md](capability-evaluation-loop.md) for
  the detailed staged execution once a broad idea is selected.

### 2026-06-14 — Kanban row powers extended + validated across agent surfaces

- **What changed.** Added three real, schema-derived Kanban powers to the shared
  `growthos.actions` layer and exposed them through the local assistant,
  GatewayCore channel tools, MCP, and the in-app console governed action list:
  `annotate_item(database, title, note)` appends dated Notes without clobbering;
  `set_item_field(database, title, field, value)` changes real schema fields
  such as Section, Area, Priority, Risk, Due, Tags, Pillar, Format, Module,
  Action, Acceptance, and Owners; `remove_item_field_value(database, title,
  field, value)` removes one exact value from grouped text fields such as Tags,
  Topics, Owners, and Media without clearing the field.
- **How it stays careful.** Field names, field types, and select options are
  read from `appflowy_kanban/growth-os/config/schema.yaml` (including
  `*_board` and `*_content` templates), not invented in prompts. Status/column
  movement remains routed through `move_item` or lifecycle verbs. Approval,
  row-key, writeback, and generated fields (`Status`, `CardKey`, `Key`,
  `MissionID`, `LastSync`, `Created`, etc.) are not editable through the generic
  field tool. If a row's stable key cannot be determined, the write refuses
  rather than risking a duplicate row.
- **Honest boundary.** This does **not** pretend to change AppFlowy board
  view-layout/group-by/visual formatting: the current REST client writes row
  fields, not view settings, and existing setup scripts already document that
  board grouping must be set in the UI. Blank field clearing is also not
  claimed because the current client intentionally drops empty writes; removing
  a free-text grouping is supported only when another grouped value remains,
  while select fields must be changed to another valid option.
- **Validation.** Focused tests passed: `pytest tests/test_actions_intent.py
  tests/test_agent_kanban_ui.py` = 42 passed. Broader surface tests passed:
  `pytest tests/test_gateway_toolcall.py tests/test_memory.py
  tests/test_board_state.py tests/test_kanban_surface.py
  tests/test_tool_safe_roles.py tests/test_actions_intent.py
  tests/test_agent_kanban_ui.py` = 89 passed. Full suite passed: 555 passed.
  `ruff check` passed on all touched code/tests.
  `uv run cc validate` passed (config validation, cross-refs, render,
  forbidden-provider gate). Live/read-only abilities smoke passed 24/24 via the
  shared logged dispatch (`scripts/test_abilities.py`): all five hops live,
  field-edit verbs present, no approve verb, and 31 tools wrapped by the
  agent-call log. Structural exposure check passed: assistant tools + GatewayCore
  dispatch both include memory and all three Kanban field verbs; in-app governed
  actions include all three field verbs. Live read-only GatewayCore multi-turn
  check passed: one conversation recalled a marker on turn 2 with zero tools; a
  fresh conversation abstained with zero tools; no board or memory writes.
- **Tracker synced.** The detailed agent-kanban tracker now carries the same
  row-power contract and honest AppFlowy REST boundary:
  [AGENT_KANBAN_SURFACE.md](backend/projects/AGENT_KANBAN_SURFACE.md).
- **Scratch hygiene.** The sandbox-created `.codex_tmp/` pytest directory was
  ACL-owned by the sandbox identity and could not be deleted by the normal user;
  it is now ignored as local scratch so it cannot pollute git status or
  repo-corpus hash tests.
- **Left in order.** (1) Verify AppFlowy REST support for clearing values and
  view-layout/group-by changes before adding those powers. (2) If verified, add
  a narrow view-layout tool with explicit schema/API evidence and tests. (3)
  Feed real action outcomes into the existing data-derived Kanban tuning path;
  no speculative learner or fake threshold before that signal exists.

### 2026-06-14 — Puppetmaster reviewed as a routing reference, not adopted

- **Decision.** Added §5.1: Puppetmaster is **BORROW_PATTERN_ONLY** for
  auditable routing artifacts, rejected-route reasons, failure classification,
  and typed worker outputs. It is **not** adopted as a runtime router because
  that would duplicate LiteLLM/Judge Gate/Ledger authority, add hooks/MCP
  auto-invocation, and re-open provider-API routing this repo forbids.
- **Safety/data boundary.** The borrowed artifact shape may store bounded
  metadata, config hashes, real LiteLLM usage fields when present, redacted
  evidence references, outcome, confidence, and sha256. It must not retain raw
  transcripts, secrets, `.env` content, provider tokens, hidden eval content,
  or full secret-bearing diffs.
- **Ordered backlog.** Mission 1 is complete: Judge Gate's risk→alias mapping is
  now data-derived from validated configs. The next work is linear: add Ledger
  routing artifacts; then feed those artifacts into the existing `routing`
  improvement target once a declared fixture/statistical plan exists; only then
  consider a one-mission Puppetmaster adapter spike with hooks disabled and no
  provider keys. No defensive fallback, fake cost, invented threshold, or
  speculative learner is permitted along that path.
- **Checks run before this doc update.** `uv run cc validate` passed;
  `pytest tests/test_routing.py tests/test_model_scout.py tests/test_vram.py`
  passed (29 tests); `pytest tests/test_all_target_types.py
  tests/test_improvement_lifecycle.py tests/test_promotion.py
  tests/test_experiment_runner.py` passed (47 tests).

### 2026-06-14 — durable memory WIRED into the live gateway + validated 8/8 (deep + cross-conversation)

Applied the wiring the 2026-06-13 entry below built + staged, and validated it live end-to-end.
Memory now works through the real gateway — the cross-conversation gap from the multi-turn proof
is closed in production.

- **Wired at the root, mirroring `board_state`.** `core.py` loads `self.memory_cfg` once in
  `__init__` (right after `load_tool_layer` puts growthos on the path, like `self.board_knobs`) and
  re-injects via `_memory_messages(query) -> list[dict]` at turn start + mid-loop on memory's **own**
  refresh cadence (guarded against a 0 cadence exactly like the board's `refresh and …`).
  `assistant.py` registers the `remember`/`forget` verbs in `TOOL_FNS` + a SYSTEM instruction;
  `collect_memory_state(query, cfg)` takes the config (loaded once, not per call). No defensive code:
  fail-loud-render mirrors `board_state`, the cadence guard mirrors the board's, the embedder fails
  loud, the store is per-owner + curated-only. Patch doc marked applied:
  [memory-integration-patch.md](memory-integration-patch.md).
- **Live-validated 8/8** (real `qwen3:30b` + `nomic-embed-text` + AppFlowy board). **S1**: remembered
  in conversation A → recalled "black, no sugar" in a **fresh** conversation B → `forget` propagated to
  D. **S2**: a 7-turn conversation recalled focus + deadline at turn 7. **S3**: facts saved in **three
  different conversations** all recalled in a 4th. **S4**: recall used **zero tools** (pure
  re-injection, confirmed via `run_turn_events`). The store held only curated facts (no transcripts),
  with the agent self-tagging facts to the `betts_basketball` project. **Definitive deep proof**: a
  fact stated at turn 1, after enough turns to evict it from the `deque(12)` rolling window, was still
  recalled in the same conversation — `in_deque=False` + recall succeeded + fact in store ⇒ provably
  from memory, not history.
- **Hygiene.** The S2 agent over-eagerly staged 2 mission cards + 1 todo on the real board (it read
  failing-DAG context and acted); **reverted** to Backlog/Todo (the pre-existing `geo_social_pipeline`
  Ready card left untouched). **No memory leak**: tests isolated `memory.db` to a temp dir
  (`GROWTHOS_STATE_DIR` verified to take effect); production `_state/memory.db` has **0 rows**.
- **Gates.** ruff clean on all applied files; 39 hermetic tests green (21 memory + 18 vram); full
  suite exit 0; `core.py` adds no new mypy errors (the growthos imports match the pre-existing
  pattern; only the pre-existing line-73 `logged` typing remains, not mine).
- **Backlog (worked 2026-06-14; ordered, each with its real blocker — nothing built speculatively):**
  1. **Per-conversation project scoping — DEFERRED (no data-derived source yet; not a fabrication).**
     The store + `retrieve(project=…)` support it and are tested, but there is no clean source for a
     conversation's *active project* today: the channels are general-purpose (no inherent project); a
     per-channel `project` config would touch ~6 agent-surface files for a feature **no channel uses**
     (dormant ⇒ speculative); inferring it from the text is guessy; and an agent `focus(project)` verb
     can't work because the tool layer is conversation-agnostic (tools get `name`+`args`, never the
     `conversation_id`). Meanwhile **relevance already separates projects softly** — a betts fact won't
     surface for an unrelated query — so `project=None` is *correct* for general channels. **Activation
     path when wanted:** introduce a project-specific channel, add an optional `project` to its
     `channels.yaml` spec, thread it `GatewayConfig → collect_memory_state(project=spec.project or None)`.
     That is an operator/product decision (which channel is project-scoped), not code I should invent.
  2. **Sharing-vs-acting — PARTIALLY ADDRESSED 2026-06-14.** Refined the memory SYSTEM instruction
     (`assistant.py`): "simply sharing a fact is NOT a request to create/stage/change a board card or
     todo — remember it and reply; touch the board only when the user asks." A live re-run of the exact
     S2 trigger now made **zero board writes** (vs S2 staging cards) — suggestive, but one turn is noisy
     (LLM variance) and proactive `remember` stays model-dependent (explicit "remember X" is the reliable
     path, proven 8/8). The broader board action-bias is still the **agent-surface session's** persona to
     fully tune.
  3. **Learned retrieval-weight tuner — BLOCKED on a usefulness signal.** A tuner needs
     `(query, injected facts, was-it-useful)`; the **usefulness label is not logged and has no clean
     source** (no explicit feedback; `forget` is only weak negative signal). Prerequisite, in order:
     define + log a usefulness signal, let it accrue, *then* the abstain-until-it-beats-the-config-
     baseline tuner (same discipline as the cadence learner). Building it now would be a learner with no
     signal — not done.
  4. **Router learned pre-router — DEFERRED** (data-gated; the cascade covers it until escalation data
     justifies it), per the prior router decision. Unchanged.
  No defensive code, no hardcoded thresholds, no fabricated values, no leakage at any step — and,
  deliberately, **no speculative plumbing for sources that don't exist yet.**

### 2026-06-13 — durable cross-conversation memory (built + proven), embedder VRAM budget, router decision

Executes the `memory_state` design the multi-turn analysis pre-specced (see the entry below
and [agent-multiturn-and-memory.md](agent-multiturn-and-memory.md)). The board already carried
durable *work state* across conversations (board_state); this adds durable *conversational*
memory the same way.

- **Memory subsystem — built, tested, proven live (not yet wired).** New
  [growthos/memory.py](../appflowy_kanban/growth-os/growthos/memory.py) +
  [config/memory.yaml](../appflowy_kanban/growth-os/config/memory.yaml): `remember(fact)` /
  `forget(fact)` intent verbs (siblings of `stage_card`/`reject_card` — the agent saves a
  *curated* fact by explicit intent; nothing is auto-harvested from raw conversation, so there
  is **no leak surface**) plus a `collect_memory_state` re-injection that mirrors `board_state`.
  Backed by a per-owner SQLite store with the real local `nomic-embed-text` (reused from
  score.py). It keys on a **stable owner, not the conversation id** — that is what makes recall
  cross-conversation (a fresh conversation has a new id but the same owner) and it survives a
  restart. Retrieval is `cosine × recency-decay`, top-k — no relevance threshold; **fails loud**
  if the embedder is down (no keyword/recency degrade). Every knob is required in `memory.yaml`
  (no hidden code default). 21 hermetic tests ([test_memory.py](../tests/test_memory.py)) + a
  live real-embedding proof: a fact saved in conversation A is recalled in a **fresh** conversation
  B, survives a store restart, is superseded by `forget`, and is project-scoped — with **no
  cross-project or cross-owner leak**.
- **Wiring staged, not applied.** The two touchpoints (`core.py` memory_state injection,
  `assistant.py` verb registration) are the agent-surface session's hot files (core.py was being
  edited minute-by-minute), so the ~10-line, pattern-anchored patch is staged in
  [memory-integration-patch.md](memory-integration-patch.md) to apply once that session lands.
  Coordination rule held — none of their files were touched.
- **Embedder charged against the GPU budget (applied).**
  [vram.py](../src/command_center/registry/vram.py) gained `resident_weight_gb` (data-derived
  from `/api/ps` ground-truth → `/api/tags` weights + the CUDA baseline, **never a hardcoded GB**)
  and a `reserved_gb` term threaded through the fit math; `model-fit --reserve-model
  nomic-embed-text` now sizes chat models *after* the resident embedder. 5 new tests. Live: the
  embedder reserves **1.1 GB** (0.3 GB weights + the CUDA baseline) — small enough that it does
  not flip any verdict; a 30B-Q4's fit stays context-bound (it holds ~29k ctx on the 24 GB card
  with the embedder resident, and is NO at the full 65k default). The gate now charges for the
  embedder instead of assuming it free — the number is data-derived, not asserted.
- **Router decision — keep the spine, defer the pre-router.** The stack already runs the two
  strategies the current router literature rates highest: domain routing (the `roles` map) and
  cascading (stuck-escalation, local → Claude Code/Codex on *observed* failure). LiteLLM stays the
  gateway. A learned complexity *pre-router* (wrap `ulab-uiuc/LLMRouter` or RouteLLM, trained on
  the escalation + Ledger outcome logs already being collected) is **deferred until it can beat the
  cascade on a temporal holdout** under the existing promotion wall — abstain-until-better, can only
  improve on the baseline, never regress. No build now; collect the signal first.
- **Left, in order:** (1) apply the staged wiring patch when the agent-surface session lands, then
  run the post-apply two-conversation check; (2) optional — give `memory_state` its own
  refresh cadence + thread a per-conversation project context; (3) accumulate escalation data, then
  add the pre-router only once it beats the cascade. No defensive code, no hardcoded thresholds, no
  fabricated values, no data leakage at any step.

### 2026-06-13 — Chat bot full-capability pass: research comprehension (`read_item`), capability-tiered prompt, proactive updates (`cc notify`)

Once the tool-call leak was fixed (entry below), made the bot able to do work at
**every tier**, not just board hygiene. Data-derived scope: grepped which tools
each capability needs; only three real gaps existed (the repo-work loop was
already wired end-to-end). Nothing breaches the approval wall — the bot still only
DRAFTS and MONITORS; executors complete gated missions.

- **Understand papers/repos (`read_item`).** New read-only tool in
  `growthos/actions.py` (+ `TOOL_FNS`): returns ONE row's full detail (abstract,
  score, curator "suggested-for", url) so the bot can actually explain/triage an
  item, not just list titles. Exact match → else closest candidates (never a
  silent guess). Verified live end-to-end: asked to explain a paper, the bot
  called `read_item` and summarized it + flagged it suggested for betts_basketball.
- **Capability-tiered system prompt (`channels/core.py build_system`).** Rewrote
  the terse prompt to enumerate all four tiers (boards · research · awareness ·
  repo work) and HOW to drive repo work: `add_mission_card(section, action,
  acceptance, risk, repo)` → human drags to Approved → gated Ledger mission →
  executor (Claude Code/Codex) completes it → `mission_status` to track. A model
  only uses abilities its prompt names. Verified: asked to fix a failing betts DAG,
  the bot drafted a card (section DAGs, repo betts_basketball, measurable
  acceptance, L2) with the approve-to-dispatch handoff — write intercepted, no
  junk card on the board.
- **Proactive updates (`cli/notify.py`, `cc notify` / `make notify`).** Channels
  are reactive; this is the one job that messages YOU: composes the daily brief
  headline + active Ledger missions and posts to your Discord channel. "Active" =
  `board_state.LIVE_COLUMNS["missions"]` (one source of truth, no re-listed
  literal). Fail-loud on missing creds / unreachable Ledger (never a fake
  all-clear). Run it on a host schedule like the kanban bridge. Verified: real
  push of a 1237-char digest (2 active missions) to the channel.
- **Repo-work loop confirmed already wired:** "Betts Basketball" is a kanban
  section (`configs/kanban.yaml`) → repo `betts_basketball`; the bridge turns an
  Approved card into a gated mission an executor runs. The bot's part (draft +
  monitor) is what the prompt now teaches.
- Tests: `tests/test_actions_intent.py` (+read_item), `tests/test_notify.py` (5).
  Full suite 541 pass (1 pre-existing flake, passes in isolation, untouched code).
- **Follow-ups resolved (2026-06-13):** (1) **`cc notify` schedule — documented**
  as a run-yourself `schtasks`/cron one-liner in `docs/channels.md`, mirroring the
  kanban-bridge/snapshot tasks; agents do not self-install host persistence (§13),
  so the one command is yours to run. (2) **`read_item` extended to `notes`** —
  verified live; its valid set is now `STATUSES | {notes}` (`READABLE_DBS`), since
  notes is a real content board with no Status workflow. (3) **kanban.yaml risk
  strings — no change needed:** `RiskTier` values literally ARE `L0_read_only`…
  `L4_dangerous`, so kanban.yaml's `L2_local_edits` is the canonical enum value
  (the bridge also accepts the agent's short `L2`); shortening it would break the
  `KanbanSection` contract. Not a defect — the earlier note was speculative.
- **Only genuinely-open item:** you run the `cc notify` schtasks one-liner once to
  make the daily push automatic (until then it's `cc notify` on demand).

### 2026-06-13 — Discord bot leaked raw `<function=..>` XML — root-caused to qwen3-coder's Ollama tool parser; chat surfaces moved to a `chat` (qwen3) role

**Symptom.** The Discord bot replied with raw tool-call markup
(`I found "Alan Turing: The Enigma"… <function=book_note><parameter=…>…</tool_call>`)
instead of acting on the kanban. The local AppFlowy assistant never had this.

**Root cause (reproduced, not guessed).** Discord routed through role `triage` →
`ollama_chat/qwen3-coder:30b`. qwen3-coder's Ollama Modelfile carries
`RENDERER/PARSER qwen3-coder` (a compiled-in native parser for its
`<tool_call><function=..><parameter=..>` XML); its Go template has **no** tool
handling. When the model writes a sentence of narration *before* the call
(which it does naturally), that native parser fails to extract the block, dumps
prose+XML into `message.content`, and returns `tool_calls: []`. `core.py` then
treats the markup as a final answer and sends it to Discord. qwen3 / devstral
use Ollama's Go-template tool path, which parses calls regardless of surrounding
prose. The local assistant works because it runs **qwen3:8b**, not qwen3-coder.
Measured, narration induced: qwen3-coder **7/8** (Ollama) and **6/6** (full
LiteLLM path) leaked; qwen3:30b **0/8**. Fix verified e2e via `model=chat`: **0/4**.

**Scope — which roles actually tool-call (data-derived).** Grepped every model
call: only `channels/core.py` (chat) and Hermes (`HERMES_DEFAULT_MODEL=planner`)
pass `tools` through LiteLLM. `judge_gate` uses JSON-mode completion (no tools);
no local code tool-calls `coder`/`architect-judge`/`security-judge`. So qwen3-coder
is correct for those (plain completion) and only the **chat** and **planner**
roles needed to move off it. `triage` (judge-gate JSON) is unchanged.

**Fix (data-derived, no patching).**
- `configs/models.yaml`: new `chat` role → `qwen3:30b` (tool-robust, fits 4090);
  `planner` moved off qwen3-coder → `qwen3:30b` (+ `devstral:24b` cross-family
  failover) because Hermes tool-calls through it. Both documented off-limits to
  qwen3-coder. `triage`/`coder`/judges keep qwen3-coder (no tool-calling).
- `configs/channels.yaml`: all chat channels `model: triage` → `model: chat`.
- `channels/core.py`: final answers run through `_clean()` (strip `<think>`,
  parity with the assistant); a **fail-loud tripwire** (`_leaked_tool_call`) now
  refuses to forward unparsed tool-call markup — it logs the evidence and returns
  a diagnostic naming the cause + fix, so a future fragile-model regression is
  loud, never silent.
- `cli/check_cross_refs.py`: new `check_tool_safe_roles` makes the fix
  self-enforcing — `make validate` FAILS if a chat channel's role or `planner` is
  ever backed by a qwen3-coder-family model (prefix match, so future tags too).
- Rendered + restarted LiteLLM (`chat` + new `planner` live in `/v1/models`);
  `make validate` green. Verified live (narration induced) via `model=chat` and
  `model=planner`: **0 leaks, 23 tool calls parsed**. Tests:
  `tests/test_gateway_toolcall.py` (5) + `tests/test_tool_safe_roles.py` (5).
  Everything stays local (qwen3/devstral on Ollama) — fail-closed invariant kept.

### 2026-06-13 — LinkedIn content pipeline (two AppFlowy content boards + official-API publisher)

A Claude-Code-authored content operation for **geoffhadfield32** (personal) and
**World Model Sports LLC** (company Page), shipping through LinkedIn's **official**
Posts API — no scraper, no third-party scheduler, content never leaves the box.
Full design in §6.6; what's left (all user-credential prerequisites) in §9.

- **Boards.** `content_template` added to `growth-os/config/schema.yaml`; new
  `scripts/new_content_board.py` (create + reconcile, mirrors `new_project.py`)
  stamped `geoffhadfield32_content` and `world_model_sports_content` — Grid +
  Board view, 3 columns **In Queue → In Progress → Completed** (the only kanban
  the user asked for). A `Key` field round-trips the writeback `pre_hash`.
- **Contract.** `ContentConfig` (+ `ContentSource`/`ContentStatuses`/`LinkedInApi`/
  `LinkedInAccount`) in `schemas/contracts.py`, file `configs/content.yaml`, wired
  into `cc validate`. Endpoints/scopes/statuses are config; the LinkedIn-Version
  header has **no code default** (always explicit). `.env.example` gains the
  `LINKEDIN_*` keys; secrets are named-not-stored.
- **Client + publisher.** `src/command_center/linkedin/` (3-legged OAuth + text
  post for member & organization authors; raises loudly, never fakes a publish)
  and `cli/linkedin_publish.py` (dry-run default · `--login` · `--apply`). Mirrors
  the kanban bridge: reads each board, ships only `In Progress` rows with
  `ScheduledFor <= now` and empty `PostURN`, stamps `Completed` + `PostURN` +
  `PublishedAt` by `Key`. Temporal-safe; failures stay In Progress and retry.
- **Seed.** 60 real, **source-attributed** drafts (30/account, derived from
  llm_station, betts_basketball, bball_homography_pipeline, Growth OS curriculum)
  in `config/content_seed/*.json`, loaded by `scripts/seed_content.py` (clobber-safe
  insert-only, 1/day) as **In Queue**. Verified live: 30+30 rows, publisher reports
  **0 due** (the human approval gate holds).
- **One path, no external MCP.** `.mcp.json` registers **no** posting MCP — the sole
  publish path is `linkedin_publish`. An external posting MCP would be a second route
  bypassing the board gate + a second token store; the `stickerdaniel` scraper can't
  post anyway. Future conversational control = a thin MCP over *our* publisher.

**Hardening pass (same day, after external review):**

- **LinkedIn-Version fix.** `202506` is **June 2025** (YYYYMM), sunset 2026-06-15 —
  corrected to **`202605`** (current Latest). Comment now flags the YEAR+MONTH format
  and the ~12-month sunset; it must be re-checked before going live.
- **Anti-double-post.** New `linkedin/ledger.py` — a durable `PublishLedger`
  (`generated/linkedin-published.json`) marks each Key PUBLISHING→PUBLISHED around the
  POST, so a post whose AppFlowy writeback failed is reconciled, never re-sent; an
  ambiguous send (timeout) → `RECONCILE_REQUIRED`, never auto-retried. A
  `ProcessLock` (OS advisory, no stale timeout) stops overlapping scheduler runs.
  `tests/test_linkedin_publish.py` 6/6 (gate, temporal safety, ledger, lock).
- **Least privilege + secrets.** Scopes trimmed to posting-only (dropped `email`,
  `r_*_social`); the OAuth token store + ledger + lock added to `.gitignore`
  (token = secret). `--apply` prints token expiry each run (60-day token).

### 2026-06-14 — agent kanban surface: Phase 6 usability round 4 (inline field editing)

- **Edit any field from the card drawer.** Each field gets an inline `edit` (→ governed `set_item_field`) and an
  "+ Note" box (→ `annotate_item`, clobber-safe), built on the field-editing verbs a concurrent session added.
  Adjust Priority/Area/Risk/Due/Tags/etc. on any board at any time. Verified live: `Priority=P3` set; **Status
  edit refused** ("use move_item"); **invalid `P9` rejected** with the data-derived allowed set
  `['P0','P1','P2','P3']`; note added; reverted. The wall holds (Status/keys not editable here; protected fields
  server-refused). Frontend-only (uses existing `/api/action`); SPA recompiled clean.

### 2026-06-14 — agent kanban surface: Phase 6 usability round 3 (drag-and-drop)

- **Drag-and-drop on the Boards kanban.** Cards drag between columns; dropping calls the governed `move_item`
  and the live board refreshes. The card-details dropdown does the same (the earlier "won't let me" was the
  absence of drag, not a backend bug — `Ready -> In Progress` verified working). **The wall holds through drag**:
  dropping onto `Approved` is refused with a clear message (human-only), shown as a toast. Verified live:
  drag→In Progress reflected on the live board; Approved drop refused; reverted.
- **Clarity** — Missions is labeled the gated execution lane (open → Ledger to approve/kill); Boards →
  mission_intake is where you move work freely; a live/snapshot label on the board. SPA recompiled clean.

### 2026-06-13 — agent kanban surface: Phase 6 usability round 2 (formatting + detail)

- **Stack-health topbar.** New `/api/status` runs real liveness probes (Ledger; + LiteLLM + AppFlowy when the
  console is on) — live: `{ledger: ok, litellm: ok, appflowy: ok}`. The topbar shows a colored dot per hop +
  last-updated + a manual refresh button. A hop is "ok" only if it answered (no fabrication).
- **Nav counts** for quick orientation; **persistent chat** (the Chat view stays mounted so the conversation
  survives view switches); **Escape** closes any drawer.
- **Richer mission drawer** — colored event timeline with timestamps, an Approvals section, and an "Open in
  Ledger to approve / kill" link for L3/L4 / awaiting-approval (the signed path stays in the Ledger UI).
  `test_agent_kanban_ui` 15/15; ruff clean; SPA recompiled clean.

### 2026-06-13 — agent kanban surface: Phase 6 fix+polish (from the live visual pass)

- **Governed writes now work.** The visual pass surfaced two real bugs: the in-app channel logs every tool call
  (like Discord) but the agent-call log was mounted `:ro` (→ `Read-only file system`), and AppFlowy was unreachable
  from the container (growth-os/.env `localhost:8081` = the container, not the host). Fixed: log mount `:rw`;
  `APPFLOWY_BASE_URL=host.docker.internal:8081` (the Ollama pattern). Verified live: `stage_card -> Ready`,
  `move_item -> Backlog`, HTTP 200, board reverted.
- **Observable agent chain.** `load_tool_layer(surface)` records each channel's calls under its own surface; in-app
  calls now show as `app` in Activity (verified). `/api/action` routed through the logged dispatch (was bypassing
  the log).
- **Adjust any board, see it at once.** `board_view` carries each board's full legal statuses; the card drawer
  gains a "Move to…" dropdown (→ `move_item`) for EVERY board + quick verb buttons for cards/todos. `/api/boards/live`
  (console-only) reads AppFlowy live so a write reflects immediately; the drawer refreshes after each action.
- **Chat polish.** Cleaner tool-call rendering (verb + arg) + a clear button. `test_agent_kanban_ui` 14/14; ruff
  clean; SPA recompiled clean (caught a missing import before merge).

### 2026-06-13 — agent kanban surface: Phase 6.4–6.6 (the console becomes a channel — chat, writes, streaming, SMS)

- **In-app chat + governed writes + model pick (6.4).** The UI is now a first-class **channel**: `/api/chat`
  embeds the same `GatewayCore` Discord uses, so you talk to the agent in-app and it moves/assigns tasks through
  the **governed action layer**; `/api/action` exposes the governed verbs directly (card action buttons). You
  **pick the model role per turn** (validated against `models.yaml` — no free-form model). Gated by
  `KANBAN_UI_CHAT_ENABLED`: off ⇒ the read-only board deployment holds **no creds**; on ⇒ the full console mounts
  growth-os + `.env` (the trust fork). **L3/L4 approve/kill never reach the browser** — the action verbs refuse
  Approved structurally. **Live-verified**: the in-app agent answered "1 mission awaiting approval" correctly from
  the injected board state, and `approve_card` was refused (400).
- **Live streaming (6.5).** New `GatewayCore.run_turn_events` async-generator + `/api/chat/stream` (SSE) stream
  each step — round / tool call / tool result / final — so you watch the LLM work live. **Verified**: events
  stream as they happen.
- **SMS + multi-channel (6.6).** New `channels/sms.py` (Twilio webhook → `GatewayCore` → REST reply); `sms` added
  to the `ChannelSpec` transport literal (the runner auto-dispatches it); a disabled `sms-main` in `channels.yaml`.
  Agents are now reachable from Discord/Slack/Telegram/WhatsApp/**SMS** + **in-app**. **Phone access** = the
  responsive console over Tailscale (6.1). SMS needs Twilio creds + a public webhook to run (like WhatsApp).
- **Standards held:** writes governed (no Approved/L3/L4 in the browser); model list + router data-derived from
  config; chat gated so the secure read-only default holds no creds; SSE errors surfaced as events, never
  swallowed; fail-loud throughout. `test_agent_kanban_ui` 19/19; `make validate` green; ruff clean; SPA recompiled
  clean. Remaining polish (tracker §8): per-board move UI for the long-tail boards, token-level streaming, SMS
  live test once Twilio creds exist.

### 2026-06-13 — agent kanban surface: Phase 6.1–6.3 (operator console — redesign, deep detail, router)

- **Console redesign (6.1).** The UI is now a left-nav multi-view console — **Missions · Boards · Router ·
  Observability · Activity** — responsive for phone (`@media` collapses the nav, stacks columns, full-width
  drawer), with per-view filtering (free-text + risk). Rebuilt + live on `127.0.0.1:8787`.
- **Deep detail (6.2).** `actions.board_view` now carries every scalar card field; clicking ANY item opens a
  drawer — missions show status/risk + the event timeline, AppFlowy cards show **all fields** (where it is, what
  it is). Snapshot regenerated against live AppFlowy (cards carry CardKey/Section/Risk/Acceptance/Action/…).
- **Router / agent-chain (6.3).** New `/api/models` reads `models.yaml` + `judges.yaml` (configs mounted RO) —
  live: **7 roles, 2 executors, 9 judge stages**, all data-derived (no hardcoded model names). The mission drawer
  surfaces the per-mission routing chain from `model_call`/`judge_verdict` Ledger events.
- **Standards:** still **read-only** (writes/chat are the planned 6.4 fork); router/lanes data-derived from real
  config + real events; fail-loud (missing config/snapshot = loud 503). `test_agent_kanban_ui` 12/12; ruff clean;
  SPA recompiled clean (caught + fixed two TS strict errors before merge). Plan for 6.4 (in-app chat + governed
  writes + model pick), 6.5 (live streaming), 6.6 (SMS/multi-channel): tracker §8.

### 2026-06-13 — agent kanban surface: Phase 5 (parity — AppFlowy breadth + Cline depth)

- **Parity review.** Measured the surface against the two yardsticks (AppFlowy availability+databases,
  Cline look&feel for agent use) and closed the gaps. Full review + per-use-case verdicts in
  [backend/projects/AGENT_KANBAN_SURFACE.md](backend/projects/AGENT_KANBAN_SURFACE.md) §6.
- **5.1 — regression fixed.** Dropping `set_status` (Phase 2) had removed the agent's ability to triage
  papers/repos/signals and update library/lessons status. New title-addressed `move_item(database, title,
  status)` restores action on **every** board with statuses — loud validation, harness owns the key, Approved
  still structurally refused. Dedicated verbs remain the ergonomic path for cards/todos. (`test_actions_intent` 13/13.)
- **5.2 — AppFlowy database breadth in the UI, with NO creds in the UI container.** `actions.board_view()` +
  `board_state.all_boards_json()` produce a structured read of every board; `make kanban-board-snapshot` runs on
  the **worker** (where AppFlowy creds live) and writes `generated/board-snapshot.json`; the UI mounts that file
  **read-only** and serves `/api/boards` (frontend board tabs: mission_intake/todos/dags + research inboxes).
  Snapshot freshness shown; missing snapshot = loud 503. Resolves the creds-in-container tradeoff (same pattern as
  the agent-call log). Per-board fail-loud.
- **5.3 — Cline depth.** `/api/activity` (recent agent actions, newest-first, from the agent-call log) drives an
  activity feed; mission cards are now clickable → a **detail drawer** (`/api/mission/{id}` status/risk/events with
  per-kind tags). (`test_agent_kanban_ui` 10/10.)
- **Standards held:** every read fail-loud; snapshot per-board errors recorded never hidden; UI stays read-only
  (no write path); no new deps. `make validate` + `make kanban-surface-validate` + full pytest + ruff green.
- **Live-verified.** Snapshot CLI now self-bootstraps growth-os (sys.path + CWD at the growth-os root) so
  `make kanban-board-snapshot` produces real data — ran it: 6 boards, 0 errors (dags 87, papers 68, repos 55,
  signals 56, cards 12, todos 8). Freshness via a **user-run** schtasks/cron (agents don't self-schedule, §13).
  `docker compose --profile ui up agent-kanban-ui` built (SPA compiled) + healthy on 127.0.0.1:8787; all
  `/api/*` endpoints returned live data and `/` served the built SPA. Only a human eyeball at the URL remains.

### 2026-06-13 — agent kanban surface: Phase 4 (first-party Cline-styled web UI)

- **The styling, combined.** New optional service `services/agent_kanban_ui/` fills the
  already-budgeted Phase-4 WebUI slot — repurposed from the deferred Hermes WebUI. A FastAPI
  backend serves a React/Vite/TypeScript SPA (Cline-style dark board: missions grouped into
  status columns with risk-colored cards + an observability panel) **single-container** (the SPA
  is built in a node stage and served as static assets), behind loopback/Tailscale/password.
- **Read-only by construction.** It reads the **Ledger** (missions = the execution kanban) and the
  **agent-call log** (metrics, via the same `command_center.kanban.metrics` as `make kanban-digest`,
  so UI and CLI can't disagree). There is **no write path**: approving/killing stays in the signed
  Ledger endpoints (the HMAC secret is never given to the UI), so `external_write_policy:
  governed_by_ledger` holds by construction. AppFlowy stays the human staging surface. Ledger-down
  is a loud 502, never an empty board.
- **Wiring.** `configs/ui.yaml` block + `WebUIConfig` field renamed `hermes_webui` → `agent_kanban_ui`
  (contract unchanged); `docker-compose.yml` service behind `profiles: ["ui"]` (loopback-bound,
  agent-call log mounted read-only, healthcheck); multi-stage Dockerfile (node build → python serve).
  Backend `tests/test_agent_kanban_ui.py` 5/5 (grouping, unknown-status disclosure, 502-not-empty,
  metrics reuse, read-only). `make validate` + `make ui-validate` green; ruff clean. The SPA build
  runs in the Docker node stage (authored this session; not npm-built here).

### 2026-06-13 — agent kanban surface: Phases 1–3 (the function half — harness-owned state, intent verbs, observability)

- **Phase 1 — the harness owns board state.** New `src/command_center/channels/board_state.py`
  re-injects the live board (open cards/todos/missions, grouped by column, overflow disclosed) into
  BOTH agent loops every turn ([channels/core.py](../src/command_center/channels/core.py),
  growthos `assistant.py`) so the model never calls `list_*` just to remember the board — the Cline
  focus-chain pattern. Fail-loud: an unreadable source renders an explicit `ERROR:` line, never an
  empty/stale block. Cadence/size/fuzzy knobs are externalized to a new validated `configs/agent_surface.yaml`
  (`AgentSurfaceConfig`, in `make validate`). `tests/test_board_state.py` 7/7.
- **Phase 2 — intent verbs replace generic CRUD.** `actions.py` gains `stage_card/block_card/reject_card`
  and `start_todo/finish_todo/block_todo`, addressed by title (the harness owns the board, the canonical
  column, and key resolution — `_resolve()` fuzzy-matches with a data-derived ratio and returns candidates
  on a miss, never a silent guess). Generic `set_status` dropped from BOTH agent surfaces (assistant
  `TOOL_FNS` + MCP registrations); it stays for the bridge/scripts. Approved remains structurally human-only.
  `tests/test_actions_intent.py` 7/7.
- **Phase 3 — observability + data-derived tuning.** The existing agent-call log (`growthos.observability`
  → `_export/agent_calls.jsonl`) is reused as the event spine — no parallel store. New
  `src/command_center/kanban/` computes real metrics (redundant-call rate, intent-verb adoption, error/latency),
  a champion–challenger `fuzzy_min_ratio` learner that **abstains below the decision floor** (mirrors the
  discovery scan's `acceptance.py`; temporal split, no leakage), a Markdown digest, and a blocking N/N gate.
  `make kanban-digest` + `make kanban-surface-validate` (6/6 PASS — the gate caught a real verb→terminal-column
  bug before merge). `tests/test_kanban_surface.py` 9/9.
- **Standards.** All knobs in `configs/agent_surface.yaml` (no literals); decisions data-derived or honestly
  abstaining (no fabricated cadence); fail-loud (no silent fallbacks); no leakage (pre-decision features only);
  AppFlowy/Ledger keep write-authority. `make validate` green · full suite green · ruff clean · mypy
  baseline-consistent. Tracker: [backend/projects/AGENT_KANBAN_SURFACE.md](backend/projects/AGENT_KANBAN_SURFACE.md).
  **Phase 4 (the first-party Cline-styled web UI in the repurposed WebUI slot) is the remaining, separable lift.**

### 2026-06-13 — agent kanban surface: Phase 0 (decision + tracker + doc reconcile)

- **Direction set.** The fix for "agents don't drive the AppFlowy board well" is to invert who owns board
  state (adopt Cline's harness-owned-state + intent-verb pattern), keep AppFlowy/Ledger as the data/authority
  layer, add a data-derived observability lane, and put a first-party Cline-styled board + observability UI in
  the **already-budgeted** Phase-4 WebUI slot (`configs/ui.yaml` / `WebUIConfig`) — repurposed from the
  now-deferred Hermes WebUI/Kanban. Not a §13 "another abstraction layer": it fixes a failure actually hit and
  adds no competing authority boundary. Ordered plan + standards-conformance matrix:
  [backend/projects/AGENT_KANBAN_SURFACE.md](backend/projects/AGENT_KANBAN_SURFACE.md).
- **Doc reconcile.** Stale Hermes-WebUI references corrected to the first-party repurpose:
  `configs/ui.yaml` comment, [ui-options.md](ui-options.md) dashboard table, [ecosystem.md](ecosystem.md)
  banner. The `WebUIConfig` contract (loopback/password/`governed_by_ledger`/single-container) is unchanged;
  the block key renames to `agent_kanban_ui` in Phase 4. Docs-only; no code/config-value change yet.

### 2026-06-13 — Cline CLI + Ollama evaluated → DEFER (watch-list)

- **Cline CLI (Ollama `ollama launch cline`) assessed against the stack → DEFER.**
  Cline is an *executor* (read repo / edit files / run commands / diffs, plus a
  local per-task kanban) — a peer to Claude Code and Codex CLI, **not** to
  Command Center. As a replacement for the control plane it's a strict
  downgrade: it brings none of the L0–L4 wall, Judge Gate, Ledger/leases,
  one-mission→one-worktree isolation, proactive/RCA lane, or the kanban→Ledger
  bridge (its kanban has no approval wall). As an alternate *executor* it's only
  marginally interesting and is Phase-4 "only when a need is actually hit"
  territory — Claude Code already covers primary coding, the `coder` alias covers
  local. Its `--model …:cloud` path would also break the no-provider-keys,
  fail-closed local-only contract. Less differentiated than the Hermes spike,
  which was already deferred — so an easier DEFER by the same yardstick. Recorded
  in §13. No code, config, or dependency change.

### 2026-06-13 — agent abilities verified + centralized agent-call logging

- **One action layer, three surfaces, all logged.** Confirmed the Discord agent, the MCP/Claude
  agent, and the local `chat.bat` assistant all dispatch through the *same* 20-tool layer
  (`growthos/actions.py`); the model picks the tool. New `growthos/observability.py` wraps every
  surface's dispatch so **every tool call is recorded** (surface · tool · truncated/secret-safe
  args · ok/error · latency) to one JSONL; `python -m growthos.observability` is the live monitor.
- **Abilities proven.** `book_note` exercised live on *Alan Turing: The Enigma* (5 dated notes,
  persisted + read back). New `scripts/test_abilities.py` drives each query tool ≥5 ways and the
  approval wall ≥5 ways through the logged dispatch — **25/25 PASS, 9 tools routed, every Approved
  attempt refused**. Hermetic test `tests/test_agent_observability.py` (4/4).
- **Board layout — resolved (no destructive flatten).** The queue→in-progress→complete flow is
  delivered by the agent-kanban-surface session as lifecycle *intent verbs* (`stage_card`,
  `start_todo`, `finish_todo`, `block`/`reject`) over the existing statuses, so the semantic boards
  keep their lifecycles and the wall is now *structural* — there is **no `approve` verb**. Verified:
  `test_actions_intent.py` (14) + `test_abilities.py` (23/23: query tools routed, wall holds, all
  24 tools logged).
- **Self-improve daily → human-gated Kanban card.** New `discovery/kanban.py` +
  `improvement scan --kanban` drafts the top findings as `mission_intake` Backlog cards (Section =
  Command Center, risk mapped from the finding's tier to L0–L4, fails loud on an unmappable tier —
  no fallback); the daily DAG drafts them each morning behind `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_KANBAN` (off by
  default). Observer-only — a human drags to Approved → the bridge opens a gated mission → applied.
  Proven live (a "remove swallowed exceptions" card on the board). Tests: `test_discovery_kanban.py`
  + `test_dag_support.py`; tracker [SELF_IMPROVEMENT_PIPELINE.md](backend/projects/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_PIPELINE.md).
- **Multi-turn + cross-conversation memory — proven & assessed.** A live 6-message conversation
  through the shared `GatewayCore` (`model: chat` → `qwen3:30b`): read 13 cards → drafted a card →
  **recalled it with no tool call** (within-conversation memory) → "stage *that* card" → "reject it"
  (context resolution + the structural wall, no `approve` verb), then a *fresh* conversation id that
  could **not** recall the draft and answered from the re-injected board instead. That pins the model:
  board/work state is durable & shared across conversations (via `board_state` over one AppFlowy
  board), but conversation history is per-conversation `deque(12)`, in-memory, lost on restart. All
  four channel adapters (discord/slack/telegram/whatsapp) wire to this same core + `chat` role, so the
  proof covers every channel; only Discord is live. Assessment + tiered, data-derived recommendation
  (instrument first via the agent-call log; `memory_state` re-injection if cross-chat reference shows
  up; persisted histories for restart-durability — no leakage, no hardcoded thresholds):
  [agent-multiturn-and-memory.md](agent-multiturn-and-memory.md).

### 2026-06-13 — OKF knowledge bundle + dashboards on the tailnet

- **OKF knowledge producer.** New observer-only subsystem `src/command_center/knowledge/` (+ the
  `knowledge` CLI / `make knowledge-generate|validate`) that reads authoritative sources (configs,
  the Ledger, code, DAGs) and writes a Git-backed `knowledge/` bundle of OKF concepts under a strict
  `growth-os-0.1` profile. Source systems produce OKF; OKF never modifies them (every concept is
  `authority: derived` and points at its source). Clobber-safe generated/human split; data-derived
  freshness (no timestamp churn on unchanged source); a blocking N/N validation gate (frontmatter,
  source-path existence, link resolution, secret scan). First generation: 14 concepts, 7/7 PASS.
  Design: [knowledge-format.md](knowledge-format.md).
- **Dashboards on the tailnet.** Airflow / Ledger / LiteLLM / Uptime-Kuma now served over Tailscale
  (8443 / 10000 / 11000 / 12000) — tailnet-only, verified reachable. [remote-access.md](remote-access.md) updated.

### 2026-06-13 — self-improvement scan: data-derived ranking + delivery + standards pass

- **Data-derived ranking.** Every scan decision moved out of code into `configs/discovery.yaml`
  (`DiscoveryConfig`, in `make validate`) — no inline literals. Added `improvement/discovery/
  acceptance.py`: a pure-Python logistic `P(accept)` learner from the Ledger's card accept/reject
  history (leakage-controlled features, temporal split, champion–challenger vs the ICE/RICE/WSJF
  formula; abstains below a documented sample floor). Records features at draft time (the feedback loop).
- **Delivery.** `improvement/discovery/delivery/` — an email digest (stdlib SMTP; dry-run writes
  HTML, fail-loud on missing creds), a one-line chat ping, and a `Pillar` column on the Kanban board
  for per-pillar swimlanes. CLI flags `--email/--board/--ping` + a new-since-yesterday diff.
- **Standards (principles-only).** Module-tree + 5-stage header on `pipeline.py`; a blocking
  `improvement scan-validate` gate (10/10 — asserts the observer wall + no-leakage); a report
  manifest sidecar (sha256 + provenance). Verified the `docs/backend/` R2/fleet/Railway/medallion
  standards are the betts pipeline's and **don't apply here** (no such infra) — applied only the
  transferable principles. Tracker: `docs/backend/projects/SELF_IMPROVEMENT_PIPELINE.md`.
- **Zero new deps**; full suite + ladder (validate · scan-validate · evals) green; ruff + mypy clean.

### 2026-06-13 — model-selection track + routing check + Hermes spike

- **WS1 hardware-fit selector.** `registry/vram.py` (GQA-aware VRAM formula off Ollama
  `/api/show` + `/api/tags`, `/api/ps` ground-truth) + `cli/model_fit.py` + `make model-fit`
  + `tests/test_vram.py`. Budget reads `gpu_vram_gb` (new `EnvironmentSpec` field) from
  `environments.yaml`. Live finding: the 30B incumbents need ~39k ctx (not 64k) on the 4090.
- **WS2 model scout rewrite.** Fixed 3 bugs (dead source-gate, archived HF leaderboard,
  AA-shaped score keys); keyless-first sources (Aider polyglot + Ollama tags, AA optional via
  `AA_API_KEY`); every candidate annotated with the WS1 fit gate. `tests/test_model_scout.py`.
- **WS3 confirmed pre-built** — the `model` target was already wired end to end (harness,
  adapter, `EXP-model-ref`, parametrized lifecycle test); no new code. Deleted the dead
  `llama3-groq-tool-use:70b` (can't fit 24 GB).
- **Routing check.** Coding is executor-driven (Claude primary, Codex cross-provider fallback);
  local models never do primary coding. Added judge-route cross-ref validation to
  `check_cross_refs.py` (a typo'd `escalation_role` was unchecked) + `tests/test_routing.py`.
- **WS4 Hermes spike → DEFER.** Ran v0.16.0 isolated (local Ollama, no keys). Cross-session
  memory PASS (local `MEMORY.md` — not beyond-stack); self-improving skills FAIL (curator
  auto-created 0 skills). The "phantom image" note (§ above) is now corrected. Evidence under
  `evaluation/capability-assessment/hermes/`; tested `safety_preflight.py` corrected to the real
  v0.16.0 schema (the drafted `data_collection` key does not exist).
- **Roadmap.** `docs/system-roadmap.md` is the consolidated whole-system map; `STATUS.md` tracks
  the tactical order. Track A (model selection) + the routing check are complete.

### 2026-06-12 — docs consolidated to one setup path

- **Four overlapping setup docs became one.** `runbook.md` (phases + daily flow),
  `COMPLETE-SETUP.md` (prior master map + buy checklist; stale at "ten config files"),
  and `SETUP-REMAINING.md` (remainder checklist + "complete means") were folded into
  `SETUP-FROM-SCRATCH.md` — now the single ordered path from nothing-installed to
  definition-of-done. `growth-os-system.md` (status snapshot) folded into `STATUS.md`.
- **`PREFLIGHT-FIXES.md` retired.** Historical; its "add ANTHROPIC/OPENAI keys" advice
  was already superseded by the local-only correction (recorded below) and keeping the
  file risked someone following it.
- **Stale duplicates removed from disk:** `_staging/` (three pre-`src/`-layout copies of
  this repo). All live references updated (README, this doc, visuals, Makefile,
  autonomy-idea-map, growth-os-engineering, growth-os selftest process check).
  Changelog mentions of the retired files below are intentionally left as history.

### 2026-06-12 — GitHub-ready: src/ layout, multi-channel gateway, hygiene

- **Repo made GitHub-ready.** Comprehensive `.gitignore` (secrets, caches, dumps,
  staging); every secret confirmed ignored via `git check-ignore` before staging;
  stray tarball + egg-info removed; `appflowy_kanban/AppFlowy-Cloud` registered as a
  pinned **git submodule** (was a vendored clone with its own `.git`); MIT `LICENSE`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and a PR template added.
- **Full `src/` relocation.** `schemas/` → `src/command_center/schemas/`, `registry/`
  → `src/command_center/registry/`, `scripts/*.py` → `src/command_center/cli/`;
  editable-installed package. Every `from schemas import` → `command_center.schemas`,
  `sys.path` bootstraps dropped, `parents[1]` repo-root anchors → `parents[3]`. The
  Makefile, `cc.ps1`, CI, `breakage.yaml`, the evaluation gold-set, and the two
  growth-os cross-imports were all rewired. `pyproject.toml` gains optional-dependency
  groups (gateways, dev), console entry points, and ruff/mypy config; `tests/` + a CI
  lint-test job added; `ruff check src` is clean.
- **Multi-channel gateway.** The Discord gateway became a transport-agnostic
  `command_center.channels.core.GatewayCore`, with real adapters for **Discord, Slack
  (Socket Mode), Telegram (long-poll), and WhatsApp (Meta Cloud webhook)**, a
  `configs/channels.yaml` validated by the new `ChannelsConfig` contract (each
  `channel.model` cross-checked against `models.yaml`), and a runner
  (`python -m command_center.channels [--dry-run] [--channels …]` / `make gateway`).
  The repeat-call breaker and forced-final-answer guards are preserved; selftest now
  points at `core.py`.
- **Docs.** Added `SETUP-FROM-SCRATCH.md`, `channels.md`, `STATUS.md`; refreshed this
  doc's module tree (§11.1), doc index (§12), and the §13 N/A note. Reference
  standards copied into `docs/backend/`.

### 2026-06-12 — capability-evaluation Batch 1 executed

- **Ran the evaluation loop end-to-end** against this repo for semble, abtop,
  asm. Artifacts in `evaluation/capability-assessment/` (baseline, per-candidate
  evidence/threat-model/benchmark/results, raw outputs, independent
  verifier-report, DECISION matrix). Three-role separation honored
  (Investigators + Implementer + a fresh-context Verifier that re-ran critical
  commands and corrected the recall figure from 10/10 to **7/10**).
- Dispositions (measured, not guessed): **abtop → PILOT** (7/7 Claude session
  detection on Windows, read-only verified; Codex 0/4 on Windows is the gap),
  **semble → PILOT** (7/10 NL-query recall, `.env` excluded; the "98% fewer
  tokens" claim did not reproduce vs skilled ripgrep), **asm → DEFER**
  (knocked out — zero skill files exist to manage, no Windows support,
  "signed manifests" claim false).
- Authority boundaries intact: no config/contract/service/agent file modified,
  no MCP registration, no `--setup`, no provider keys, nothing pushed. semble
  in `.venv` only; abtop binary in the eval dir only. Deterministic baseline
  re-verified PASS at the concurrently-relocated `src/command_center/cli/`
  paths. Each PILOT's next step is a separate human-approved L2 mission.

### 2026-06-12 — PILOT next steps (abtop wired · semble blocked on betts · asm parked)

- **abtop**: wired into `src/command_center/cli/usage_digest.py` as an opt-in,
  read-only `--abtop` / `--abtop-bin` section — shells the pinned binary with
  `--json` only (never `--setup`), fail-loud on a missing binary, omitted by
  default. ruff/mypy/compile clean, no new deps, baseline PASS, vendored
  binary gitignored. ADOPT still gated on Codex-on-Windows detection; re-test
  deferred (v0.4.8 is the latest release).
- **semble**: benchmarked on betts_basketball — recall 6/8 (NL search held up),
  but **not pilot-ready there**: indexing crashes out-of-the-box on a WSL
  symlink (`WinError 1920`) and the package was pruned by a concurrent
  `uv sync` (not in `uv.lock`). MCP registration gated on a committed
  `.sembleignore` + a lockfile-pinned install. betts left unmodified.
- **asm**: parked (DEFER) with re-evaluation conditions recorded.
- Full record under `evaluation/capability-assessment/` (DECISION.md is
  authoritative).

### 2026-06-12 — betts standards encoded + capability-evaluation loop

- **`configs/standards.yaml` `python_ml_pipeline` profile expanded** to encode
  the betts_basketball operating contract so every mission renders it into
  `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` and Judge Gate cites it: pipeline-template structure
  (module tree + stage registry per doc), temporal-leakage safety,
  R2-as-shared-production-DB rules (validate before / verify after upload;
  never delete `upload.lock`), desktop-4090-writer vs laptop-5080-dev-lane
  fleet split, multi-session git discipline, the uv dependency standard, atomic
  shared-volume writes, serving standards, and done/next doc hygiene.
  Sources: betts `PIPELINE_STANDARDS_TEMPLATE.md`,
  `DATA_ENGINEERING_PIPELINE.md` §0.x, `LOCAL_FLEET_R2_WORKFLOW.md`,
  `UNIFIED_SERVING_GUIDE.md`. Validated (`validate: PASS`) and test-rendered.
- **Added [capability-evaluation-loop.md](capability-evaluation-loop.md)**:
  the staged, evidence-first external-tool evaluation prompt (Stage 0–11,
  three separated roles, knockout gates, A/B benchmarks, chaos testing,
  independent verification, five dispositions), with a Part-A mapping onto
  this stack — entry via kanban/Ledger at L2, cross-provider Verifier,
  local-only-gateway and uv-dependency amendments as knockout criteria —
  and a Part-C pre-registered roster of 13 candidates (Semble, abtop, asm,
  dbt-agent-skills, Puppetmaster, MAPPA, Agno GitWiki, verifier-loop pattern,
  BigSet, BigQuery Graph, SIA, ClawCodex, AgentCookie) with sources, seams,
  stack-specific knockout risks, batch order, and a ready-to-run Batch-1
  mission brief.

### 2026-06-12 — this doc

- **Added `docs/MASTER.md`**: consolidated all 18 docs into one stage-by-stage
  system guide with module tree and this change log.
- Reconciled drift between older and newer docs in favor of current reality:
  LiteLLM is **local-only** (provider keys forbidden, fail-closed), and
  **Hermes is optional/deferred** (phantom image; the live channels are
  AppFlowy boards, chat.bat, Claude-via-MCP, and Discord). Older Hermes-centric
  passages in COMPLETE-SETUP/visuals/runbook describe the optional future
  orchestrator slot, not the present stack.

### 2026-06-12 (late) — context enrichment + loop hardening (Growth OS)

- DAG rows now carry full context every sync (Description, Owners, Tags,
  NextRun from the Airflow API) alongside root-cause Notes — the dags board is
  a self-describing inventory.
- `Suggested` column on papers/repos/signals (`growthos/enrich.py`, curate
  stage 3.5): one ≤35-word "useful for <project>" line per newly kept item,
  local model only, honest by construction; Ollama down → loud warning,
  curation never blocks.
- `book_note(title, note)` tool: dated reading notes on library rows from any
  channel.
- **In-app AppFlowy AI — verdict: blocked upstream** (the `appflowy_ai` image
  license-walls every request despite correct LiteLLM wiring). Container
  stopped; the guidelines feed watches AppFlowy releases for a change.
- Agent-loop hardening after the Discord tool-round stall: loud boundary
  validation on every list tool + deterministic loop-breakers (repeat-call
  message, forced final no-tools answer). `project_status()` one-call context
  pack and `network_health()` 5-hop liveness added. **selftest.py 22/22.**

### 2026-06-12 — local-only correction + live smoke green (Command Center)

- Architecture corrected to **local-only LiteLLM**: every role renders to
  `ollama_chat/...`; OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter deployments are
  contract-rejected; `make forbidden-providers` + live smoke enforce the
  boundary; no cloud fallback — calls fail closed. **This supersedes
  `PREFLIGHT-FIXES.md`'s instruction to add provider API keys.**
- State green on the workstation: digest pinned, virtual keys minted, health
  passing, `live-smoke` printing real local replies, `cc.ps1 check` passing
  (recorded in SETUP-REMAINING.md).
- Hermes made optional in Compose behind a profile (the
  `nousresearch/hermes-agent` image is not published).
- Airflow sync live: 81 DAGs, root-cause failure summaries (deepest
  non-site-packages frame), auto-drafted Backlog fix cards; human-set
  `Retired` rows never touched.
- `mission_intake` gained the writeback fields (MissionID, CardKey, LastSync);
  bridge proven end-to-end: T-b5f2e70f dispatched + written back,
  T-c8e1d7d6 held at the L4 wall. Bridge scheduled q15min (user-run schtasks).

### 2026-06-11/12 (evening) — Growth OS autonomy layer

- Library seeded with the full 275-book curriculum (import idempotent, never
  clobbers Status/Notes).
- Approval made **structurally human-only**: `actions.set_status` refuses
  Approved on every agent surface; bridge applies Approved-only.
- **Discord gateway** built (`services/discord_gateway/`, LiteLLM `triage`,
  same action layer, fail-fast without token).
- Knowledge watchers live: papers/repos/signals hourly (embedding-scored),
  guidelines daily (standards mirror + uv/Airflow/AppFlowy/Ollama release
  feeds), packages (122 direct deps watched, semver-derived severity),
  retention (7d). `projects.yaml` observe-registry added;
  `new_project.py` board stamper proven.
- Decisions recorded: no separate channel service; no agent-installed
  scheduling (classifier-blocked twice, by design); Claude-mobile remote
  connectors can't reach the tailnet (accepted trade).

### 2026-06-11 — v4 contract stabilization (Command Center)

- **Typed contract layer** over the v3 architecture: every `configs/*.yaml`
  validates against a Pydantic model; `extra="forbid"`; cross-file linter;
  JSON Schema rendering for editors; breakage map + `make impact`.
- Added the proactive ops lane (runtime health + repo stewardship + RCA loop,
  eight unsafe-config rejections tested), standards rendering
  (`standards.yaml` → CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md + Judge Gate), usage digest, and
  propose-only model scout with canary/promote/rollback targets.
- Pre-flight fixes (PREFLIGHT-FIXES.md): `make bootstrap`/`verify-base` to
  break the first-boot key circularity; placeholder digest now **blocks**
  (`verify` exits 1, `up` runs `verify` first); `OLLAMA_API_BASE` wired into
  the litellm service. *(Its provider-key instructions were later superseded —
  see 2026-06-12 above.)*

### Earlier — v3 architecture (carried forward)

- The base design this all stands on: VPS brain · Tailscale mesh · gateway +
  Judge Gate + Ledger · leases · 4090 worker · VS Code tunnel ·
  pre-commit/pre-push judge arrays · L0–L4 gates · GitHub branch-protection
  wall.
- v4 keeps all of it and layers on: the typed contract layer (above), a
  proactive ops lane (DAG/data health + repo stewardship), standards rendering,
  usage digests, and propose-only model scouting. Everything the README once
  filed under "unchanged from v3, still current" lives in this guide now —
  §6 (the five pipelines), §7 (isolation), §8 (the GitHub wall), §5 (model
  lanes), and the doc index in §12. The README no longer tracks the v3→v4
  delta; it points here.
